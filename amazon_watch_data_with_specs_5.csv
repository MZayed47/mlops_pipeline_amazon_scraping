This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2024",M.,"The SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is an exceptional device that combines durability, advanced technology, and AI-powered features for both everyday use and fitness tracking.

[PDF ]",Freddy Ard,"For quite some time I have wanted to purchase the Casio G-Shock DW5600, but when I considered the additional features of the Casio G-Shock GWM5610, I decided to spend twice the $.  My only other G-Shock experience (excellent) is with a DW6900, which I have owned about 5 years, considered my beater or tough duty/activity watch.  The handy instruction booklet got me reasonably familiar with the functions and settings sequences, although I might have to refer again on certain matters.  Accordingly, set up to my preferences was quick, simple, and in short order I began the enjoyment of this digital watch.The black resin band is secured comfortably and easily by a traditional polished silver buckle and tongue.  Although describe in larger metrics, I would say the face appears much along the lines of 40mm on my 6-7/8"" wrist.  It is relatively lightweight, and generally comfortable to wear.  The excellent backlight far outperforms that of any I have seen on the Casio products.  All the functions perform outstandingly.  The solar-power and atomic timekeeping are really cool features, and frankly, seem to account for increase in price over the DW5600.  Since I have only had mine a few days, I can't yet attest to the durability, but have no doubts that it is rugged and can stand up to anything I will give it.  I dig the appearance and the display, and might say my expectations are exceeded.Now, for the more ""classic"" piece, I guess I will have to order me a companion DW5600 to alternate with my GWM5610.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 5, 2024",D.B.,"This is perhaps as close to a perfect digital watch as you can get.  Besides the toughness of a G=Shock, it's got all the daily features one may need (alarm - which you can set up to 5, stopwatch and countdown timer).  It also has world time, which is a nice feature to have when travelling.  When in stop watch and time modes, the current time is displayed in the upper right corner of the display where the date normally is.  It's solar powered, and the display shows how much power the watch has.  Multi-band 6 is another feature, so it automatically sets the time once it receives a signal from an atomic clock transmitter.  YMMV with this feature though.  I have difficulty receiving the signal being on the U.S. east coast (the transmitter is in Colorado).  There are phone apps you can use to strengthen the signal if normal reception fails.  Despite this, it can be manually set if needed.Visibility of the display is an upgrade over the DW-5600.  It's more clear, and more visible at different viewing angles.  The standard backlight is now LED instead of the classic electroluminescence.  Some prefer the latter.  This may or may not be a deal breaker based on personal preference, but considering what this watch has to offer, it should only be a consideration in the bigger picture.The watch offers a great fit for G-Shock.  With its slim profile, it lacks the bulk of many of the other G-Shock models out there.  It's very comfortable to wear on different size wrists, though the strap may not be everyone's cup of tea.The design is very much retro, harkening back to the 1983 original square with the red border.For the price of this watch, it really is a great value.  It's also possibly the only digital watch you'll ever need unless you want other functions like tides, barometers, etc.  In my collection, this watch is one of my favorites. There's a good chance it will become one of yours too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2024",Dennis F. Cwik,"For the past 10 years, I've thought that mechanical watches had so much charm and passion, while quartz watches were soulless devices. I picked up this watch to be a ""beater"" when my automatic watches weren't suitable, but I've actually grown quite fond of the GW-M5610. What's not to love about a light, small, tough-as-nails, super accurate, solar watch?I got this watch from Amazon on April 5, 2019 (in the USA). First thing I noticed was that it did not come in the hexagonal tin box that a lot of older online reviews show, but a flimsy cardboard box with a simple display holder. At first I was annoyed, but honestly the box would have just been tucked away in storage with other watch boxes that never see any use.After unboxing, you'll find a warranty card, a handful of manuals in various languages, and the watch in a simple plastic bag (no protective stickers on the crystal or caseback, no fancy hangtags). I immediately checked out when the last sync time was (bottom right button), which happened to be on November 1. Assuming this sync happened before it was packaged up, that meant it was sitting for 5 months in the dark, but it still showed high power (as indicated at the bottom of the display, where there's a L, M, H meter). Yay for power saving mode!Next step was to set the timezone. The manual states that the default timezone after losing all power is Tokyo. I assumed this was what the watch would be shipped with, but mine was set to NYC by default. I'm curious if watches sent to the USA are set this way, or if someone played around with this watch. After selecting my local timezone (Pacific), it was only 2 seconds slow! I know quartz watches are accurate but that is phenomenal, especially considering the manual states +/- 15 seconds per month without a signal calibration.Speaking of signal calibration, I've had my watch automatically sync about every other night in Seattle. I have an old Casio Waveceptor (10 years old) that never syncs anymore. I don't know if that's because it has become defective, or the GW-M5610 can pick up a weaker signal strength. Regardless, there's no need to worry about missing a few nights in a row of syncing, as it'll still be very accurate.The caseback on mine was machined and not stamped, with crisp engraving (FYI, I removed the serial number from the image, normally found on the bottom of the caseback). As far as I know, only older models will have the stamped, rounded version. While on the wrist, it feels just as comfortable as any rounded caseback I've had.I really like that the resin strap is already pre-rounded/pre-shaped. I've had tough, flat rubber/plastic/resin straps on other watches that were incredibly uncomfortable (I'm looking at you, SKX009). On my 6.25"" wrist, the watch strap keeper is right at the end, and there's maybe 1/4"" excess strap sticking out. If your wrist is smaller, you'll unfortunately have more strap sticking out, which will probably be a bit annoying.Other reviews state that the A-EL feature didn't work on their watches, which is the auto-illumination when you tilt your wrist up. Mine works flawlessly. I'm curious if this was an issue with earlier models that has since been addressed.The only minor annoyance I can find with this watch is the non-standard lug width/strap. I think the stock strap fits it perfectly (both in terms of comfort and aesthetics) and have no desire to change it, but it's proprietary. That being said, I'm sure it won't be hard to find a replacement strap if needed.The GW-M5610 has a perfect blend of retro styling, useful functions, durability, comfort, and laziness (it sets itself!).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2019",2011,,2.08 ounces,,,,,,

Sharp,"This watch is perfect. It is super compact, super durable, super simple, and it costs as much as a fast food meal. It is the most sold non smart watch ever. If you need a watch and don’t need it to connect to your phone, there is literally no reason to buy any other watch, unless you are one of those weirdos that are obsessed with how watches look. It is also super intuitive and easy to use, and the alarm function works great as well. It has 7 years of battery life, which, at a $20 price point is less than one cent per day to always know the time, have a stopwatch, and have an alarm. At night, the light works great, and during the day, it is easily readable. I’ve already bought this watch twice, and I just got it again for an upcoming trip where I won’t have my phone. However, I’ve realized that having a watch is just better. Instead of fishing around in your pocket and getting sucked into YouTube, you can just glance at your wrist. Smart watches are dumb and gimmicky. Dumb watches are the way to go, and this is the best dumb watch out there. And if you are even considering buying an analog watch I genuinely don’t know how to help you. Can your analog watch set timers, have a 24 hour clock, have a stopwatch, or be super precise? I didn’t think so. And this watch is waterproof too.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024",William Greene,Simple watch for a very low price but gets the job done.

I consider this watch to be utilitarian and perfect for anyone who works with their hands, outdoor laborious work; basically a tradesman’s watch. It is basically the same watch from many years ago introduced by Casio that started the digital watch revolution. Its old style uniqueness is a conversation starter as well. The price and watch is such that you can put it through the wringer and not worry or feel bad about it. It certainly will hold up to whatever you throw at it. Yes, it’s small, the band could be better, but it’s actually just perfect how it is and what it is for. I love this watch and it makes me smile every time I look at it - a sort of nostalgic simplicity that is just there, kind of like a reliable friend.

I own both a Fitbit and Apple watch – I was getting tired of being tracked all the time and getting notifications about everything (which yes, I know can be adjusted).  I’ve owned Casio watches before and still have a G-Shock digital that’s been running great for almost 20 years, so after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, it was an easy decision to make.I went with the black face and bezel model, although you really can’t go wrong with any of the other colors offered.  It’s a classic diving watch that, in my opinion, looks sturdy, cleaner and more elegant than some of the more expensive competitors.  Given Casio’s proven durability over the decades and the price point of this particular watch, you can't miss with this one.There are a ton of You Tube videos and review articles online about this diver (which is a bit of a cult classic it seems) – the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly positive, so I won’t add much more here that hasn’t already been stated there.  One common “complaint” that I noticed though is regarding the stock watchband.  Many are critical of it, but I tend to disagree.I did take the advice of some and tried a few different aftermarket bands – the Barton elite silicone, a Ritchie classic leather band, and a Ritchie nylon NATO strap (all available on Amazon).  With the exception of the NATO, I personally found the stock Casio diver band the watch comes with to be the most comfortable of the others tried – not taking away from or knocking the others by any means, it’s just a “why spend the extra money” type thing for a $50-ish watch.  Simply a personal thing…Re the NATO strap in my pics:  I did keep the Ritchie Premium Nylon strap to compliment the watch.  It really does dress it up and make the timepiece pop for more “formal” occasions if you will – and very comfortable too.  For everyday use though, the stock classic diver-style band turned out to be the most practical for me – one I recommend over aftermarket options and especially for those in the trades or who are knocking around on the beach, out hunting, at the lake, etc.If I had to be critical of any aspect of this watch, it would be the luminescent capacity of the hands and markers – something also frequently mentioned in many of the reviews I read online.  It’s marginal at best.  When blasted with high intensity light, the markers glow brilliantly initially, but it does seem to fade quick.  I mention it because if this is an important feature for you night owls, it is something to consider. For me, it’s acceptable and not enough of a factor for me to change my rating of the piece.Bottom line is that I highly recommend this waterproof diver.  It’s superior quality with Casio durability and reliability at a price that can’t be beat.  It keeps d***-near perfect time and doesn’t have to be charged on a daily basis or wound ever – just a simple, inexpensive battery keeps it going for a couple of years.  You will not be disappointed with this one!  Thx, DTEdit 2/2/2024:  A word on timekeeping:  Having owned this watch for a while now, it does GAIN a few seconds every month.  I go to www.time.gov to set adjust time every now and then...  It's still more accurate than my other watches though - amazing considering this is a $50-ish dollar piece.  Highly recommend this watch!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2023",Kevin Matthew Spears,"This watch, especially for the price is amazing.

Its not over done on the dial and is a nice purely simple diver watch with a moving bezel and date window. $57 and its a great looking watch that goes with casual or a bit more dressed up clothing. The main thing I'd recommend changing is the watch comes with a 22mm watch strap. The rubber one that comes with it is a bit cheap feeling, but its easy to change with a small flathead or correct watch toolkit as amazon sells, I had an extra nylon front/leather back (wrist side) sitting around on a watch i wasn't wearing and was same 22mm, swapped them around not only is the nylon one more comfortable, it looks better too. Images in review show the casio swapped with the other watch i swapped the bands on, the silver case is the casio with the band that came factory from the black case one with the casio factory strap, as i don't wear that particular watch as often as the casio. This casio is comfortable and very accurate as well as seeming to be very sturdily built.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024",Bjoerk,"I wanted a weekend beater for surfing and off-road motorcycling. It had to be big-faced and easy to read at a glance. No digital crap, please. I needed another watch like a hole in the head. I have some really nice watches and I'm not a collector. But since I am single and nobody around to tell me no, I got it. Great value for the price, just an impeccable knockout of the Rolex Submariner of old that I always envied.  As soon as I got it as set the time and took it surfing.  I banged it around, held it under water, sprayed with a fire hose, took a shower with it, and just hammered it with abuse as much as I could so I could return it promptly.  No success; I could not destroy it. It still holds time to the millisecond with no fogging and no problems.  Just a big hunk of phat shiny blissful steel with black highlights, a discrete second-hand, a tight rotating bezel and a light rubber wristband.  For $37 this is a steal.  I might just hang up my Tag Heuer and Victorinox watches until this thing lets me down, which may be a while.  Very easy to read at a glance which is why I got it. Not too heavy, really shiny, Big and fat. Classic good looks.UPDATE: \December 5, 2014.\ 'still looks brand new, has not lost even 1-second of time. How can this be more accurate than my $1,500 dollar Tag Heuer???? I've worn it every day since I got it..  :) The rotating bezel is still tight, firm and crisp and you can update the calendar without stopping the second hand. This should cost a lot more.UPDATE: \October 17, 2015.\ Replaced the battery finally, Still holds the time to the millisecond and not a scratch on the bezel or the steel. Every short month I calibrate it to the atomic clock NHIST in Colorado and it has never failed to be dead nuts on. The rubber wristband and the chrome look like brand new. I have really abused this thing and it just laughs at me.UPDATE \April 6, 2016 \ The band finally gave out, I replaced it at a watch store for $10 with the exact same type. I went to set it to the atomic clock, and did not need to adjust the time at all. Right on the money; still keeping perfect time. Still looks like day 1.UPDATE \Sept 27, 2016\ I hate this watch, I'm looking for a reason not to wear it anymore, It just keeps going on and on and looking brand new. Now all my other watches have had battery death from neglect, Why did I ever buy anything else? I wear a Casio over a Rolex and can't find any reason to switch back. My VW gets the job done and my Rolls Royce sits in the garage. fooey.Update 8/16/2023 OMG, will this thing finally just die???!! No, just keeps time to the second, looking fresh as the day I bought it. I'm getting tired of seeing the same glorious glistening crystal smerking at my doubt and disbelief 🫢. I way underpaid, it way over performs.

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Customer,"Ha. This is a watch of contradictions. Cheap, yet well-made. Small, but noticeable. Old, but it feels so damn new. The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I’d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for “handsome guys” and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a “major uggo”. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It’s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I’d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn’t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. “I’m with Casio,” he says. Or maybe “Dime sith mass E oh”. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I’ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn’t the first time he’d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered “Acceptable. Seven out of ten.” Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. “Sir? Sir? Are you okay?” I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don’t kid yourself. Perhaps you’ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that’s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I’ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021",Cliff,"It’s a classic digital watch.

I have an apple watch but sometimes want to wear just a simple watch. The silver is a perfect color and hasn’t tarnished or anything for the time i’ve had it. The instructions were easy to use for setup but there was no instructions on how to adjust the size of the watch which was odd because it isn’t that obvious to figure out. After a short google search I was able to resize it fairly easy. I like that it shows the date information as well as it having a light for low light situations.

This is a real review by just a regular normal guy. This is a really good watch for the money. It has all the features of a high end smartwatch but without the high cost. It looks nice while wearing it. I thought the face would be really big, but its actually a perfect size for my wrist. It lets you answer phone  calls  and read text. You cannot reply to text only read because you have no keyboard, but that's ok for me at least you can read them. You can change it up and customize it anyway you would like through the Zepp app. There are a lot of free apps and custom watch faces on the app that you can download for free. The health features are all great ,Heart rate , o2 stats and the exercise apps are all really good and keep track of multiple types of exercise like walking, running, and bike riding. All the health functions sync really well with my I-Phone.  The sleep app is really nice .You can keep track of your sleeping habits. It lets you see how long and how well you slept through out the night.  The charger charges the phone quickly and you can use it for 8-10 days depending on what apps you are running in the background.  You have to download the Zepp app to use the watch but its really not that hard and the app is very good. Its really easy to set up with the set up QR code. It comes packaged in a nice box with the charger and the user manual.  The charger  works very nice but the cord is a little short Its magnetic and it will only connect it the correct way every time. I have an apple phone and it syncs very easily to it with no issue and the Zepp app is in the apple App store. There is an Alexa link up on there so you can use your Alexa but I am not an Alexa guy so I don't really use it ,but who knows I might in the future at least its there.  All in all I say this is a great watch with a lot of very useful apps and functions. If you want a budget watch with all the high end function of an expensive watch this is for you. I really enjoy the functionality and the ease of use.  5 stars all the way.

It doesn't have a swimming app, but does a motor boating app, so you can track your boat trip...but that doesn't count as exercise.  Especially if I can cruise around the lake on my pontoon...drinking beer.  Oh...it does have a fishing app!  The GPS tracking is spot on...within a few feet.  The tracking is actually done on your watch...then sent to the phone.  I verified this by walking without my phone.  Not sure you could use it if you were hiking and got lost ...unless you have your phone with you to actually show the route.  The watch shows steps ( which is very accurate because I counted my steps over a .3 mile walk), distance, ave speed , duration, heart rate, and calories.  Battery life seems great.  I have used this for everything in notifications, and phone calls.  Had it for 4 days, and it's still at 64 percent.  I find that the sedentary reminders are a pain in the butt, so I shut them off.  I don't need to be reminded to stand up or walk when I am watching tv. The app is great...once you figure out how to navigate it.  There is sooo much on it, and it took me about 4 hrs working with it, and customizing it to suit my needs.  The watch faces are great.  There are a lot of free ones.  Even one that lets you use your own picture in the background.  The phone sound quality is really good.  I got this watch because my last one...when set to use the watch for phone calls...would send all of the phone audio to the watch.  I get that for music, but not for watching videos on my phone, so that had to go.  This one keeps the sound on my phone for videos.  You can set notifications on the watch to every app on your phone if you need to.  I have all of my cameras, messenger, and sms apps on it for now.  It is really nice that you can see what is going on with your phone in your pocket.  A must when I am driving.  You can type, and save, any quick reply text message you want, so you just select it on the watch, and it sends it.  Really safe...especially if your phone can't connect to your car.  This absolutely the best bang for your buck.  Just take your time to learn the app to set it up, and it will take care of you.  The instructions that come with it are pretty useless.  But then again...if you navigate the app or the watch yourself, you will learn more quickly than trying to read the small print on the paper anyway.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2024",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Watch feels comfortable and light but sturdy and well made.  (Case is plastic but bracelet is stainless.But case matches stainless well.) The digital display is large enough to read the time but the date image is rather small.  The analog display is not that useful but a nice-to-have. Setting the time and date is rather straight forward as it's similar to the GShocks.  Timekeeping seems accurate based on comparison with my phone's clock.  The bracelet feels very comfortable on my average size wrist.  Bracelet link adjustment is a chore as it requires fine manual dexterity and finger strength to manage the fold-over links.

I'm surprised by the quality and how much I like it. I had to remove a few links to get the metal wrist band just right. That said it's has plenty of adgusttments to get a nice fit. Feels nice and the screen is very clear and the stainless is very attractive. It feels like far higher quality then what you pay for. I'm still playing with the various settings but it's a really neat design and I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling since you can set multiple different timezones. The back light is plenty bright too with a orange glow. It has a lot going on. I was apprehensive about a watch under 30 bucks but it's worth it. I also think the metal band is well worth the extra 10 bucks. It says 10 year battery life on the housing but I guess we'll see. Lastly as far as fashion goes, I think it's nice and versatile. It looks just as good in your casual close as it does with your work attire and your Sunday best. I also like that it reads time down to the second. It's nice to know how accurately I can set this watch. How it will preform long term, I can't say but I'm optimistic judging from what I'm seeing. Anyway, I would recommend this to a friend.

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Dru Ha,"I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2023",JRC,"This is a great digital watch with a very large and easy to read display.It’s a Casio, so you know that it’s rugged and reliable.In fact, it keeps better time than watches costing thousands of dollars.The watch isn’t big on features but I really only need it for telling time .It has an outstanding price too and since it’s a Casio I expect that it will provide many years of excellent service.I have several at her Casio watches including expensive G-Shock models.The G’s are cool and they look great but I really don’t need all of their features.Also, those big watches  can be heavy and cumbersome on your wrist.Plus, this is the easiest to read Casio I have ever seen.If I could only have a single Casio watch, this is the one I’d pick.Highly, highly recommended .",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2024",Lissy,"I like watches.

This time I would have, and this was the watch I planned to buy, but they didn't have it in blue, so I abstained on the ship, and ordered this one the day I got home.So why this one?  A couple of reasons.1.) It just has that classic diver look to it.2.) A friend of mine has this watch, and EVERY time I see it when we hang out, it catches my eye.  He abuses his, and years later it still looks great, which is a testament to its durability.3.) Feature packed.Ok - so let's talk about the features.1.) Eco Drive - this is a time-tested technology, and I have several Citizen Eco Drive watches, to include a 1st Gen Eco Drive purchased in 1996 that STILL takes a charge and runs when I get it out.2.) Mineral glass window - not the scratch resistance of sapphire, but TOUGH.3.) Accurate movement.  Prior to DST, I set the watch about 3 weeks prior and it had gained a grand total of 2 seconds.  That's about +3 seconds a month.  You can't find an automatic that will do that.4.) Water resistance to 200 meters with a screw-down crown.5.) Hacking movement - when you pull the stem to the 2nd click, the second hand stops, and that allows you to sync it to the exact second to another time source.-- Side note on movement.  I considered getting the version of this watch with the automatic/self-winding movement, but the movement in that watch is the Miyota 8204, which is a 21.6k movement (rather than 28.8k) that only has an accuracy guarantee of +/- 20 seconds/day.  I have other automatics that are considerably more accurate than thatBottom line - this watch looks great, and it's built to last.  I know I'll get a lot of years of use out of this timepiece.I've included two pics of this watch.  One with the stock blue rubber diver's strap, and another with an aftermarket bracelet that is specifically fitted for this watch case.  I'd name it here but I think that would invalidate the review.  In any case, it's pretty easy to find if you prefer that aesthetic, and it isn't terribly expensive - the stainless bracelet is well worth the investment and it gives the option of either aesthetic.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2023",Eric,"Overall, one of the best pieces of work gear I have ever invested in, for my line of work.I am a swimming pool technician, a pool guy, and have been for the last 10 years of my life. I work for one of the largest pool maintenance companies in SoCal and am now a Route Manager, overseeing over 800 individual pools.My everyday has and still consists of many different jobs.Cleaning swimming pools, where I am CONSTANTLY submerging my hands in chlorinated and salinated (salt) water, which does have a corrosive and/or oxidative effect on certain metals.Interacting hands-on with different corrosive and oxidizing chemicals, all of which gets on my hands and wrists at some point everyday.Maintaining, cleaning, and repairing various pumps, filters, plumbing, heaters, automation/electrical pool systems, and valves. This frequently places my hands in uncomfortable, tight spaces where I will bang, scrape, and smash my watches against concrete, metal, and other hard materials in the equipment areas I am working in.I have worn this watch every weekday for the last 5 years for this job. I replaced the original rubberized strap for a nylon/cotton blend NATO strap so it would dry quickly and breathe better. The watch face paint has stood up very well considering how rough my job is on it, with what would be considered as understandable wear and tear. And in my opinion, it gives a worked-in quality of character to the watch.The crystal itself has a few MINOR scratches, which I’m surprised hasn’t cracked or been marred even further, given that I have truly had it banged around hard in my line of work. None of these scratches affect the readability of the watch face at all. You actually have to look in an angled reflection to notice them.The lume of the glowing hands and digits are still VERY strong and last a pretty dang long time. I’m in the sun all day long and so the glow lume gets charged like crazy all day, then lasts for hours into the night.I can also say with certainty that I have NEVER had a battery issue, being that it’s an Eco-Drive and it gets a full belly of sun every working day, I’m not surprised at all. I don’t know when it will ever need a power cell replacement, but it's probably going to be a WHILE being that my line of work puts it in a recharging state at all times.Lastly, the steel body of the watch itself is as solid as when it arrived. It does have some scratch marks, but no gouges. And just in the last 6 months or so, a very light showing of rust-colored oxidization has been showing on the inside of the bezels. I’m surprised its taken THIS long to finally show some signs of oxidizing with how often its been scratched and banged, then plunged into salt and chlorine water and exposed to various chemicals.Overall, I am very pleased with the performance and durability of this watch. In a job where I quickly go through footwear, shorts/pants, sunglasses, hats, multitools/knives/handtools, and other pieces of gear, this watch has stood out as the most rugged and long lasting piece of gear I have bought for my job. I have no doubt it will last a further 5 years easily in the exact same conditions, especially if I give a light polishing for any oxidized areas (which I still haven’t yet).Highly recommend this watch for someone looking for a durable timepiece that can take a beating and still look classy and handsome. I also highly recommend switching to a NATO strap for an even more secure retention (watch won't fall off your wrist if one of the strap bars breaks or pops out).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2024",T. F.M.,"I previously had purchased the black version of this watch because I felt the black would go better overall with my normal casual wear.  But I liked that one so much that I decided to get this blue version also.  To my surprise, it actually goes better with my clothes than the black one does.  It can be worn for casual or dress.I love the location of the crown because it does not dig into my wrist.  The size is perfect and the colors are dark blue and not overwhelming.  I have to check twice sometimes to distinguish between the black and the blue.  The face is easy to read, but I  agree with some others who in their reviews were mildly critical of the date window.  It is recessed and small and is sometimes a struggle to read.  I have found that turning towards a light source usually solves the problem.  The illumination is fine as far as my needs are concerned.  The band is sporty and comfortable.  The bezel only turns in one direction, but is tight and precise. These two watches are my 4th and 5th Eco Drives.  They keep perfect time and you just have to wear them outside or put them on a window sill once in awhile.  Overall a fun watch with excellent quality and value.Like I said earlier, I liked the first one (black) enough to buy the second (blue) and I am happy with both.  They are fun to wear and add diversion to my modest watch collection.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2016",2015,no-metal-stamp,15.17 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Ronald L. Russell,"This watch has been reviewed on Amazon many times already, so I will try to not repeat too much of what has already been said, and if I do repeat, I'll try to condense my words to what you might really be interested to know.First: This watch has some historical significance, as a replica of the only other watch known to be worn on the Moon besides the Omega Speedmaster (which I also once owned). Bulova produced just a few of these back in the early 70's (through their Swiss subsidiary Universal Geneve), submitted some to NASA for testing, and gifted one to David Scott, who took it along as ""backup"" during the Apollo 15 mission. He ended up wearing it on the lunar surface while piloting the Lunar Rover. That particular watch sold at auction in 2015 for $1,600,000.Second: Even without the historical significance, it's a technically interesting watch with unique features. The watch uses Bulova's UHF quartz movement, in which the crystal vibrates 8 times faster than conventional quartz watches. This provides extreme accuracy of approximately 10 seconds/year as well as very smooth motion of the central chronograph seconds hand. The running seconds hand located on the subdial at six o'clock ticks every half-second, not every second like most quartz watches.Third: The styling is unique among modern Bulova watches, which are often very highly polished, glittery and sometimes ""blingy"". This watch is more of a ""tool"" or instrument, with a mostly bead blasted texture, and a little bit of a brushed finish on the bezel. The crystal is a thick flat slab of sapphire, and actually protrudes a millimeter or so above the edge of the bezel, just like the original plexiglass crystal did. The pushers to activate the chronograph functions are levers which operate in slots milled in the case. The dial is very precisely detailed, and has the subdials and the track for seconds recessed slightly below the level of the main dial, while the tachymeter track is raised above the main dial, giving a pleasing three-dimensional effect. The white lumed hands and markers offer high contrast with the black dial, and very good legibility. Basically, the watch looks like something designed to do a particular job, rather than something designed simply to look pretty.Fourth: The watch is physically large. The original was 43.3 mm diameter, and because the UHF movement used requires slightly more space, the case has been slightly enlarged to 45 mm, with an overall length of 53 from lug-to-lug and about 13 mm thickness. For most people, this isn't really a problem as large watches are fashionable, and it's not stupidly large like some other examples I could name. My wrists are almost exactly 7 inches, and I already owned other watches with similar size, so from my perspective it looks large, but not TOO large. If your wrists are less than 7 inches circumference, the watch MAY look big on you, depending on your personal preferences.Fifth: The build quality is excellent. I could find no defects at all, everything worked properly out of the box. I've heard of some buyers needing to reset the chronograph hands to zero (an easy adjustment), mine were fine from the start. The back is nicely detailed with information about the Apollo 15 mission and the famous Bulova tuning fork logo. The presentation box includes an extra velcro strap similar to those actually used by NASA, as well as a tool to remove the spring bars when changing straps. The leather strap which is attached to the watch is very nice, with a texture which resembles either carbon fiber or a basketweave (take your pick). Either way, it is kind of stiff to begin with, but in a day or so, conforms very well to my wrist. I find it comfortable enough to wear while sleeping, and although the watch is somewhat heavy, after a while it is easy to forget I'm wearing it. I wouldn't choose this watch to wear during very active sports such as mountain biking, as the weight on my wrist might be noticeable then. Also, I've got other watches which are lighter and better suited for that kind of use. However, for everyday wear, the Lunar Pilot is perfectly comfortable.Bottom line (see what I did there?) is that this watch is unique, comfortable, accurate and historically significant, and a LOT of watch for the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2018",tinytaboo,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I am absolutely bonkers for this Lunar Pilot. I was a bit nervous after I ordered waiting for it to come as in the interim, I was reading a bunch of forums and watching YouTube and TikTok vids saying that this watch is too big .  I was prepping myself to feel the same and return it .. however, once It came and I opened the box.. it was love at first sight .  Pictures do not do this watch justice.. it's perfect and beautiful.  The design is slick , high contrast and precise. It feels like a luxury watch.  It's completely easy to read (which is great for these aging eyes) and I love the backstory.  I don't have a speedy, but I DO have a homage Pagani speedy.  This Lunar Pilot is bigger for sure , but it's a different animal .Again. I was initially afraid that it would be too large, however, it's no bigger than my Seiko Turtle. And definitely way less obtrusive than the bulking G shocks.  Also, since the design is classic and subdued.. it's not a huge gaudy watch like giant chunky gold blingy ones.. the straps are both great but for now I'm sticking with this included basket weave style leather.. it feels very quality. I can't say enough good things about this .  One last thing regarding the sapphire crystal. I saw another fellow online  talking about how he banged the crystal edge on a sink and chipped it.. I CAN see this being an issue as there is nothing protecting the edge. It's simply a flat slab of sapphire sitting on top of the bezel.  I imagine this is because this was based of of a prototype and is remaining true to the original.. I can see Buluva updating this perhaps ? Or maybe no.. I mean, it looks utilitarian and simple and for that reason I like it.. just hope I don't chop mine as well as I have a tendency to be rough with my toys... Anyhow.. get this watch.. you will love it",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2023",William Thomas,"It's hard to imagine a better deal than that offered by Bulova for this watch.  Often what sets a watch apart from countless other similar watches is the ""story"" behind the watch.  Whether it's the Rolex worn by Sean Connery, the Tag Heuer worn by Steve McQueen, or the Cartier worn by JFK.  The most sought after watches have a story.  Indeed, one of the most sought after watches is an Omega Speedmaster Professional.  This is the watch worn by the American Astronauts for the Gemini, Apollo and Skylab missions, and until recently, were the only watches ever to make it to the moon.  However, owning a ""speedy"" will set you back several thousand dollars, but that's what you need to spend to get a ""moon watch"".Up until now.  The story goes that David Scott, commander of Apollo 15 was given a Bulova prototype to ""test"" while on mission.  While he did not plan on actually ""testing"" the watch, he did put it in with the rest of his stuff as backup.  As luck would have it, it was needed as his Speedmaster failed when the crystal popped out, and Scott wore the Bulova on the moon for EVA 3 and on the return trip.That watch recently sold for 1.6 MILLION dollars in auction and is the only privately owned watch that has been on the moon.Bulova has taken that story and created an homage to that prototype.  The Lunar Pilot is the result.Even without the space pedigree, this is one special watch.  It's quartz movement beats at 8 times the normal frequency giving the watch an accuracy of approximately 10 to 15 seconds a YEAR vice the normal 10 to 15 second a month variance on normal quartz watches.  This movement also features a second hand that ticks every half second and a sweeping chronograph hand that is normally found only on mechanical watches.Encased in it's bead blasted stainless steel case, the watch is 45mm wide which makes it a large watch.  The watch is capped by a thick sapphire crystal, and the back is engraved with the mission information from the Apollo mission.The face detail is exquisite.  Instead of a ""flat face"" like on many watches, the seconds marker track is recessed, and the face is raised.  The 5 min lume markers are raised further on the base and the subdials are slightly recessed into the dial.  This type of detail is rarely found on a watch of this price point.A date window between the 4 and 5 position discreetly gives the day of the month.  The subdial at 3 o'clock is used for measuring 1/20th seconds in chronograph mode while the 9 o'clock subdial shows minutes elapsed.  The 6 o'clock subdial shows running seconds for timekeeping and remains moving whether or not the chronograph is in operation or not.The watch is very clean and legible as would be expected for a watch designed for space travel.  In fact the face is much like an Omega Speedmaster, not due to any copyright infringement, but rather due to the necessity of maintaining the NASA specifications already laid forward.  The case design, however is very distinctive with recessed pusher bars that pivot for the chronograph functions.  It's easy to see that these pusher bars were designed specifically to be operated by a large gloved hand.The watch itself is water resistant to 50 meters, but really isn't designed for water sports.This version of the watch comes with two straps, a leather strap and a fabric strap that is reminiscent of the NASA strap used by the astronauts. A strap removal tool is also included along with a certificate of authenticity and booklet describing the history of the watch.This watch also comes with a stainless steel bracelet version, but they are not interchangeable as the lug holes are in different locations for both watches.Even without it's interesting inspiration, this watch would be a bargain.  The accuracy of 10 sec a year makes this one of the most accurate watches you can reasonably own.  The attention to detail of this watch rivals that of much more expensive watches.  The fact that it comes with such an interesting back story makes it a must for anyone who values unique and collectible time pieces.  And you don't have to plop down several thousand dollars to do so.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2018",2019,,4.97 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,JaggedOne,"A year or two ago I bought a watch from Amazon when it was on sale for 1/2  price. It was a dandy watch, worked perfect, but it was *huge*, and pretty  heavy. It was also pretty flashy, and I'm  not. So I wound up only wearing it for ""dressy"" times, e.g., like church.  Finally, the battery died, and I decided I didn't like the watch well enough to go to the expense of buying a new battery and the hassle of putting it in.So I decided I would buy a new watch that (1) wasn't as big, heavy, and flashy as this one, and (2) didn't have a battery - I hate messing with batteries. So  I started researching watches, and when the next Amazon watch sale came along, I found a lovely *automatic*  (we called it ""self-winding"" in the ""old days"") Seiko in the ""military-inspired"" minimalist style was that I was looking for. I *almost* bought it, but the rating was a flat 4.0/5, and there were enough negative reviews about stopping working and other problems that it gave me pause. In addition, I doubted that a self-winding watch would work reliably for someone like me who doesn't wear a watch all the time.So I did some more research, and discovered that there was a 3rd class of watches - solar-powered!! And the ""solar"" supposedly means any kind of light. I found this Citizen watch that looked almost exactly like the Seiko that I liked and almost bought. It was about 85 bucks, which seemed reasonable, esp. for a watch that didn't require me to buy a battery or even to walk around...lolI've had this watch for about 32 days now. I love the look, and it is keeping perfect time. I still only wear it when I go out (i.e., not around the house),  and I've been leaving it in the kitchen where there is usually natural light during the day, plus bright artificial light on and off. So far it has worked fine. I did have to charge it under bright light for something like 12-15 hours initially, so I just left the kitchen light on overnight. I suppose some would say that cost me maybe a  quarter, but I can live with that.The strap is of decent  quality, albeit a bit stiff (I'm sure that would have loosened up with wear),  but I just didn't like having to futz with securing the strap ever time I put it on (yes, I'm old and set in my ways). This was solved by one of the major life lessons I got from my dad. Along with teaching me how to determine the model year for 50s and 60s Fords and Chevys (back when they *didn't* all look alike, and when unveiling the new model Chevy was an actual event in my small town), and warning me to ""never buy a used car, you're just buying somebody else's problems"", my dad introduced me to the Spiedel Twist-O-Flex watch band. When he bought me my first watch when  I was around 12, the first thing we did was take off the band that came with it and replace it with a brand-new Twist-O-Flex (yes, we had to take out several links to get it to fit my thin young wrist). Heck, I didn't even know you could take the band off a watch, much less change its size !!! This watch has an 18mm aperture (or w/e you call it where the band attaches), and an 18mm Twist-O-Flex fits it perfectly.The only negative would be the dearth of documentation. Other than a little folder with a few lines in about 30 languages, I was referred to a web site for info on charging and setting, etc. This is standard in the 21st century, but it still chaps me a bit.I won't apologize for the length of this review. This is the kind of review I like to find when I am considering buying an item, so this is just ""do unto others"" for me.Keep it up, Jeff B., you are doing a great job !!!P.S. I added a couple of pics with the new band, mainly to practice with my new Kindle Fire...:)",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2017",LosDawg84,"Regardless of price range, there will always be a seemingly endless amount of watches to choose from.  Sometimes it can be daunting, but always fun! This was my very first watch i purchased. I went inexpensive initially in the event watches weren't really my thing.  After a good time researching, I pulled the trigger on this little guy after reading the rave reviews. After three years of wearing this watch on and off, hiking in mountains, forests, rocky terrain, water activities, etc., I decided I would give an accurate assessment about this particular little time piece.Brand - I truly believe Citizen is the very best value when it comes to watches under $500.00.  One can argue Seiko and Orient. I own all three brands, and feel like my three Citizens are made a bit better. Citizen is well respected among watch enthusiasts, and is a FANTASTIC brand for someone looking to purchase their first timepiece Movement - As you probably know by now, this watch is powered by Citizen's own Eco-Drive Quartz Movement.  Needing no battery or servicing, this watch will stay maintenance-free for years on end.  And it just charges by light? Amazing cutting edge. Accuracy - No shock here.  Being quartz, this watch is supremely accurate.  Mine tested out about 1.5 seconds fast a week.  No arguments there!Looks - I love the way this watch looks.  Everything just works.  At 90 dollars, it's important not to try and look like a cheap, ugly homage of another watch.  Citizen did a bang up job here with a field inspired look. The dial is a matte black with white font.  The indices are not applied, but one cannot expect that at this price point.  Fantastically, the dial has day/date windows, and even has the days in Spanish (pretty cool).  The second hand is somewhat of a red/orange, but adds a really nice splash on an otherwise black and white dial.  And guess what? This watch has pretty darn good lume!  Quite impressive at this price point.  Many watches don't have any lume at all.  The hands and all of the numbers glow with a very pretty turquoise blue.  Again, do not expect Seiko divers brightness here.Size - I love it.  Now, it won't be for everyone at around 37mm or so, but there is so much dial squeezed into it, that it is always very easy to read the time.  The watch is quite thin and light, almost disappearing on your wrist.  Guys with really large wrists, may want to avoid.Enclosing, this is a spectacular little watch for the price.  For less than $100 dollars you are getting a highly respected watch brand, an eco-drive battery/maintenance free movement, extremely accurate time, minimalist and attractive design, legible night lume, and a traditional sized watch.  What a package! Sure, the mineral crystal will take light surface scratches, but that just adds to the character anyway, right? My only real complaint is the lugs are a bit sharp.  They need to round them out a bit, but fortunately they do not interfere in anyway while wearing the watch.Watches like this make you contemplate while you are shelling out 100x more money on watches.  This could serve you as your everyday companion for the rest of your life.  Sure, there will likely come a time where your taste grows and you want higher end pieces, but this BM8180 is all you will ever NEED.  Truly exceptional.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2019",,,,,2007,,7.2 ounces,,,,,,

Wouldn't even consider a G-Shocks, as I'm ex-military, and G-Shocks just remind me of the service. So... Ended up buying this little watch, and it really is much better than a G-Shock. Pros:1. The watch is 38 mm and fits perfectly on my 6.1"" wrist.2. Strap is comfortable.3. Legibility is great, large readable digits.4. Has 3 alarm clocks, each with a different tone.5. Lights keep working as long as you're pressing  buttons. That means you can finish setting whatever you need, without needing to press for lights again. Lights turn off several seconds after last press.6. Buttons are large and comfortable.7. Helps me use my smartphone less, as I'm not reaching for it anymore to tell the time and set timers.8. Unused features can be completely turned off, so they don't clutter the interface.Cons-1. Alarm clock is pretty loud. But I'm a deep sleeper, and I don't completely trust it to wake me up. Maybe if I set all 3 alarms consecutively, it might wake me up.2. Rarely, the strap pinches my arm hair.3. The occasion mode is pretty useless now that we have smartphones (But can be completely turned off).Overall really impressed with this watch, all the features feel really well thought out. I would highly recommend buying.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2024",2013,,22.68 g,,,,,,

I do like the style of the band very much, but not too happy about not being able to change or replace the strap due to the odd lug spacing. I have also been unable to find an original strap to replace this one in the event of failure in the future. Let's face it, stuff happens, and I like to be able to replace if need be. The watch came out of the box completely dead, but some time in direct sunlight got it going fine. This is my fourth Citizen watch, and I love them all.

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Nat M. Zorach,"I've always had an affinity for Bulova watches since there was a factory in my hometown. This one is stylish enough to wear in a formal context, but has a tasteful, modern flair to it-- like, you're going to see a matinee performance of the local symphony, but in the recently-opened, ultramodern auditorium, kind of a thing. The color palette is generally striking in how rare watches make good use of brown (or metallic brown) as a color for something other than leather, but then you also get the skeleton element of being able to see the spinny bits inside.Roman numerals I'm not usually a fan of because their inferior legibility to Arabic numerals, but this one I made an exception for because it was pretty. Also have glowy hands and number markings, so you can read the watch in the dark (even if it's not as clear as if the numbers were painted as well-- we can't all be perfect, including this watch).The movement seems decent and functional, but it's not a particularly high-end one, as indicated by the fact that the rotor is annoyingly loud (plus the relative lack of ornamentation). The movement itself is super quiet when the rotor isn't moving.  I don't have much experience with Miyotas but this one seems fine, and it's also easy and super smooth to set the time. They aren't super accurate so you have to check them frequently, but if you're within a few minutes and aren't using this watch to run scientific experiments that go on for weeks at a time, you should be good.There is one proper complaint I have and that's the deployant clasp. I don't have a great reason for hating deployant clasps, but I'm am much more a fan of the old school pin-and-buckle style. The big thing about this one that's annoying is that the pin to set it in place requires Herculean precision and strength to undo and adjust.

I wanted a larger watch that I could easily read without squinting or putting on glasses as I don't like wearing glasses that much as I don't need them for my computer. But, I didn't want a huge watch. So, this watch was large without being huge. I knew that the band would not fit snugly, but this band was said by other reviewers to be a big small on them. I like bands to be loose so that they can sit down on my hand when I have long sleeves on or be pushed up a few inches on my arm when I'm doing something messy like cooking dinner. I also wanted an inexpensive but dependable and classic looking watch. Because it became fashionable for women to wear watches that looked like they'd borrowed them from the guy in their life, I felt this would be fine without seeming too odd.Also, I like to check the time when I wake up because I wake up so early and don't want to get up so early that I'll be exhausted later. So, the light was important to me. I've had a few Timex watches before, and I found the Indiglo feature very helpful.I was a little concerned about the stretch band pulling my arm hairs as I'd noticed on a watch a long time ago that that happened. This one very so slightly does that but mainly because it's loose and I move it around. If it were fit so it stayed put on my arm, I don't think it would do that throughout the day. It's not actually a problem as it's so slight. I don't really notice it much.As I said, I've had a few Timex watches in my life, and they tend to keep on ticking. My last one, honestly, didn't last more than 18 months, but that was an exception. Fortunately, I got that one very, very cheaply on a sale with points and so on at another retailer. I hope this one lasts for a few years as it has for others.While I like the dull metal stretch band, I am also considering getting silicone bands in different colors. They are pretty inexpensive, and you can get the quick release type that pop in and out easily to be worn with different outfits. I'm thinking of black, buff/pink (kind of like a white person's slightly tanned skin), and red. Maybe white too. For now, I'm just using the silver band. As another reviewer mentioned, the provided band is duller than the watch. However, it actually looks good that way. It's a more casual look than it would be with a shiny band. I also think it would look good with a shiny band, however.So, having read that some people had difficulty setting the day of the week, I handed this to my young adult son as he was just sitting around playing on his computer while to did all kinds of housework. He set everything but the day and didn't bother with the day of the week. Not intending to be his slave without any rewards, I looked up directions on the internet, sent them to him, and handed it back with just enough words to every so slightly shame him into doing it. I wasn't mean, but this kid got accepted to MIT. So, he did it. I also asked here for directions and got directions from the manufacturer and several other reviewers. So, look through the questions and the answers are there. Basically, you pull the knob out and turn it through as many 24-hour days as you need to to get to the day of the week you need. I think you go clockwise. The direction matters, so check that first. It's absolutely NOT a big deal once you know how to do it. I think the reason so many people have gotten confused is that these days were are used to clicking on things and having them set right away. It's the same reason many older people have trouble with digital things. They are used to mechanical things. Anyway, it's not a big deal and it's definitely not a reason not to buy the watch.As I said, I bought this watch because it had a big face and hands and would be easy to glance at without glasses AND because it had Indiglo lighting when you push the knob AND because it had both the day and the date. I do check my online calendar daily and schedule appointments every single day for my business and personal matters. However, I admit sometimes I forget what day it is and what the date is. One reason I didn't buy the women's version of this watch is that I wanted the DAY and the date, not just the date. The women's version must be too small to have both. What I've noticed is that in dim light, I have a harder time reading small print. Also, the day and date are much smaller than the numerals for the hours. That's normal, of course. But, I do have to work a little harder to read the day and date. Further, the day and date are not illuminated by the Indiglo light. I guess because this is a mechanical watch, they are turning on different disks and don't have that feature. However, when I check my watch in the dark, I only want to know what time it is and don't need to know the day of the week and date. So, it's not actually a problem. The only thing I would say about that is that because I can read it but it's harder to read and I rarely go without my phone, the day/date feature is probably not as important to me as I made it when I made the choice of the watch. I probably could have gotten the women's version and been happy with it.As for this man's watch on me, I had the idea that women's watches are frumpy looking and liked the idea of a bigger watch face, but I probably would like the utilitarian look of this watch in the women's size. I just got this so will think about this overnight. When I pinch about 5 of the links out, the watch actually looks pretty good and not like I borrowed a man's watch. So, removing some links is also an option. As I said, my wrist is tiny, and so many women would not need to remove any links to make this watch fit and some might have to add links. If I removed 8 links, it would be snug on me, but I wouldn't be able to dangle it down on my hand if I had long sleeves with snug cuffs or push it up on my arm if I were doing something messy. So, I do have options: loose if I do nothing, snug if I remove 8 links, and semi-fitted if I remove only 5 links.And, I can use quick release silicone bands to change the look to go with different outfits. I figured out that if I got the black band, that would work for business as it almost without looking closely would come off as a black leather band. It would also have a soft, comfortable feel (based on reviews and if you get the ones that are like that so read the reviews before buying). Although I don't mind the metal expansion band and didn't notice it when I wore this for an hour on an errand, I probably would love the soft silicone bands. I'm middle aged and healthy, but if you were older or had very delicate skin for other reasons, a soft silicone band would be a great option for you. You can get soft leather bands that would feel nice, but silicone is easier to clean, can be gotten wet without staining or swelling, and is sturdy. As it is, my skin is healthy, but I have sensitive skin, not thick or rough. I can't wear pierced earrings with nickle in them. I don't think that will be an issue for this watch as it never has been for a Timex before. but I did notice that one reviewer had removed the band but left the little bars in and looped a one-piece leather band through the bars so that there was almost no skin contact with the metal. If you want to look DIY or artsy, you can even make padded fabric watchbands that have snaps to hold the watch face or use thick grosgrain ribbon to make bands to your color preference. I would even sew velvet ribbon to grosgrain ribbon or sew lace to grosgrain ribbon to make a cute band for certain casual fun outfits or a slightly dressed up event where casual touches would look cute. Because this is so inexpensive and supplies for making watch bands would be cheap due to the size needed, you could give one of these to a teen and help them come up with lots of different bands for it. You can buy band hardware (buckles, etc.) easily online.The other thing to consider if you're very small boned is that larger watch will be heavier. My son, who is 6 feet tall and energetic, walking miles fast rather than driving, and fairly strong, also has small wrists and pointed out to me that a larger watch might feel heavy. He'd been given one years ago and took it off regularly as a result. He took it off in the orchestra room while playing his cello, and someone stole it. Having said that, this is smaller than many large-faced men's watches. It's not one of those huge watches. It covers about 2/3 of my wrist width, not all of it like many men's watches would. Although I noticed the weight when I put it on because my son advised me to consider that, it didn't bother me. With a silicone, fabric, or leather band, it would be even lighter. Heavier than most women's watches, but not as heavy as those chunky men's watches.When considering how practical it is to have a men's watch, I also considered size related to the small cuffed long sleeve shirts and long sleeved sweaters one might wear to work. How much of a hassle would it be to dig under my sleeve to get to the watch in a meeting? Truth is that I could wear this watch over a long sleeved thin sweater and get away with it because my clothes are so classic and practical. Also, because I live in Los Angeles where it's hot a lot and I am a woman who prefers short sleeves and jackets or cardigans to long sleeves as my main layer to avoid hot flashes, this is really not an issue for me. I also have the option of giving this watch to my son if I decide I want a smaller one and never wear it. However, I don't think he's taken the watch I gave him five years ago off since I gave it to him. So, that's all theoretical.In conclusion, I would say that this watch is a realistic purchase for a woman, even if she has small wrists. If she has very delicate skin as elderly people often do or wants it to be lighter, you can find some very nice, very inexpensive silicone watchbands that are easily cleaned and easily interchangeable with quick release pins. If she needs something breathable due to the heat, you could go with a thin leather band, a ribbon band (a thick ribbon or two layers of ribbon due to the weight and width) or a fabric band that you make or get on a crafter sales site. Or, she could wear it over a washable wrist band or a long sleeve. I personally think this is a great watch for teenage girls and boys if they would enjoy an analog watch because they can have fun with different bands.Edited to add: I slept with this watch on, but to be comfortable doing so, I put the watch over my sleeve on my long sleeved pajama top. I'm a person who doesn't like rough feeling surfaces on my skin, and so this made it comfortable to sleep in, and I didn't notice it during the night. The weight didn't bother me either. I have a feeling that silicone bands are in my near future unless I figure out a clever way to line the band with something soft. This is not a criticism of the band as it's a normal expansion band. But, I like smooth, soft surfaces next to my skin.Also, for those who have not had the Indiglo watch face light before, the more you use it, the faster your battery dies. It's not a big deal as the battery will last long enough, but just remember that and don't give it to a kid to play with for hours unless you want to replace the battery soon.And, I already have enjoyed the day/date feature as I woke up wondering if it was Thursday or Friday and glance at it first thing after I turned the light on at 4:30 a.m.Some might wonder why you'd buy a watch with an expansion band if you really want something softer next to your skin. For me, this 35mm watch face was a better size than the 40 mm  Weekender Unisex watch Timex sells AND it has both the day and date whereas the Weekender Unisex has neither the day nor date. You can spend upwards of $40 for the Weekender Unisex with a grosgrain ribbon band or you can buy this and then go get whatever band you want. The silicone bands I like are very well reviewed and go for less than $12 apiece, so it's about the same price to get a quick release band plus the watch at a slightly smaller size that is better for me than to buy the Weekender Unisex model that is a little too big, doesn't have the day/date, and also might not have the color I want. I like the grosgrain bands a lot as they are comfortable and you can get them in lots of colors. But, you do have to wash them regularly. To wash them, I mix a little laundry detergent in very hot water in a small container, like a cup--just about half a cup of water is fine--enough to cover. Then, let it sit for several hours in that and then rub so that all the loosened soil and oil from your skin comes off, rinse in running water while rubbing and soak again in hot water to rinse. If you have to do that regularly, it helps to have another band or another watch unless you don't mind not wearing the watch for several hours. They might be more comfortable than silicone because they breathe, but the silicone can be washed and dried within minutes. For this watch to use a slip through band like the grosgain bands you can buy or make, you need the posts and I assume but don't know that you can just use the posts provided with this band. You can also buy them to make this watch accept slip through bands.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2017",Foodie,"I bought this for a guy friend whose watch gave out, and he relies heavily on his.

Reasonable price, readable, just what made both of us happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2024",Doc Holliday,"It all started when I misplaced my trusty 21 jewels Japanese automatic. Don’t ask me how it happened but it did. I’m a dad of two, self-employed, always in some sort of situation or another, and no one has accused me of being organized. It’s probably within twenty feet of me right now, but it could be on the other side of the world for all I know. At any rate, it wasn’t on my wrist anymore and I felt naked. Sure, I’ve got a phone, but I grew up with a watch, spent a lot of time learning to tell time when I was five or six, and I’m damn sure not letting that all go to waste. I had to find a decent substitute watch until mine turned up. Something affordable, something solid, something utilitarian yet pleasing to the eye. Something that could take a lickin’ and keep on tickin’. That’s it! A Timex. My first watch was a seven dollar Timex I bought with my own money when I was six. I can still remember my dad taking me to the local drugstore after school. It was a yellow brass case Easy Reader with a black rubber strap. A man’s watch, huge on my scrawny boy wrist, but I loved it and had it for many years until at some point it disappeared….See a recurring theme here?So I began my search for a watch that wouldn’t break the bank or, well, break. As I browsed, I came to this one – the Timex Easy Reader T20461. I immediately loved the look of it with its white face, Helvetica numbers, red 24-hour feature, silver-brass case, and stainless steel expander bracelet - which reminded me of the twist-o-flex watch bands my dad and grandfather always wore. The watch itself is akin to much more expensive “railroad” watches I had admired, but never considered buying. Without thinking twice I threw it into my cart, checked out and the man in brown brought it to my door within two days.Upon opening the box I wasn't disappointed. It looked better than the photos, felt solid and was easy to set. Yeah, the day and date require a little extra effort, but if this ruins your week you probably shouldn't get out of bed. It was the first time I wore an expander watch band and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn’t pinch my arm hair at all. I’m no gorilla, but I’m not in kindergarten anymore either. One thing did bother me, though. While I appreciated the band, the way it tapers just looked a little lady-like on my wrist. Or maybe it was my wrist making the watchband look lady-like. Who knows? It didn’t bother me too much and I loved the watch, so thought nothing more of it. That is, until I happened upon a watchstrap rack at a large big box store that shall remain unnamed. Hanging there was collection of the old school twist-o-flex expander bracelets I remembered so fondly from my dad and granddad. I found one that matched the shine of the watch case (the original band is a bit dull by comparison), paid a whopping 7 bucks for it (solid stainless steel), took it home, removed a few links to fit my lady-like wrist (it’s not hard – you just need a decent pocket knife and a set of needle-nosed pliers or tweezers), slid it on my wrist and voila! The perfect watch for me. Easy on, easy off; tasteful styling; understated; doesn’t scream “look at me, I spend too much money on stuff because I feel inadequate!” or “Mug me! I’m obviously fiscally irresponsible so relieve me of my money!”I hope I don’t lose it, but if I do…it’s easy to replace.  I wear it with pride and can’t recommend it highly enough for men like me that need a practical, no-nonsense, solid, reliable, unpretentious timepiece. So far it’s been dropped several times, drooled on, had coffee spilled on it and I forgot to take it off when I jumped in the shower the other day. Still as good as new. Oh yeah, Indiglo can’t be beat. You might have a Rolex, but your Rolex doesn’t have Idiglo.Sorry to say my other watch still hasn’t turned up. If it does, I’ll be happy to see it, give it a hug, then place it safely in my sock drawer until next time we meet.UPDATE: Still taking a lickin' and keeps on tickin'. Has a few character marks now, but runs as well as the day I bought it. Doesn't seem to gain or lose a second. I rarely take it off so it experiences whatever I do. I have, however, traded in the stretchy band for a leather nato that I snagged off another Timex (see pic).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2015",2014,,2.08 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Gabriel S,"Last updated: 7 Aug. 2019, 3 yrs. 9 months after original purchase.I purchased this watch Nov 2015, and the band broke June 2017. The band lasted just over 1.5 years. Note that I wore it 24/7 the *entire* 1.5 years! I literally only took it off to switch wrists probably 4 times over that period. It was on all day, all night, in the shower, in the pool, at the beach, in sports, etc etc you get the point.  I love this watch because it is super cheap (~$15) yet it has multiple alarms and a countdown timer instead of just a stopwatch timer. It's basically a G-shock quality watch for $15 instead of $45.When the band did break, it broke very suddenly! I didn't see any cracks on it or anything, but I literally rubbed my wrist across an object while turning and the band tore in two and the whole watch fell right off my wrist. Upon closer inspection, I saw cracks all along the inside of the band against my wrist, and if I bent the band hard it would break in other locations too.So, replaced the band with a nice durable nylon nato strap! I used this one (Replacement 18mm nato strap nylon watch band - Black, 5 ring Black PVD Buckle). It cost me < $10 and is an excellent watch strap! It (luckily) came with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.4mm spring bars instead of 18mm x 1.8mm diameter spring bars, which would have been too thick for this watch since there is so little space between the bars and the watch. This Casio watch comes originally with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.8mm diam spring bars, which are too thick when used with this nato strap.For the 18mm x 1.4mm bars, with a little work and a flathead screwdriver used to press the bar down hard against the strap (first to make an indentation in the band, with the bar not placed yet, and 2nd to press the bar into place), I was able to make this strap with the 1.4mm diam bars fit this watch!If you want to use a nato strap, expect it to be a very tight fit, and MAKE SURE TO GET A STRAP THAT IS 1.4~1.5mm thick max, and spring bars that are 18mm x 1.3~1.5mm MAX DIAMETER, *NOT* 1.8mm diameter. Otherwise it will be impossible to make it fit I think. I also used a spring bar tool (Ritche Professional 360pc Watch Band Stainless Steel Link Pins,spring Bars+remover Repair Tool (8-25mm)), which helped remove the old bars and situate the new bars, and I used a large flathead screwdriver with quite a bit of pressure to press the spring bar into place, indenting it against the watch, once the band was in place.Awesome watch! Awesome 18mm nato strap I've linked to above! Great combo together! I expect this combo to last me many more years than the original resin strap did.Update 7 Aug. 2019:I've had the watch now for 3.75 years. I've worn it 24/7 during this entire time: all day, all night, in the shower every day for nearly 4 years, while exercising, etc. I've only taken it off about a dozen times to switch wrists is all. I've had the 18mm nato strap on it for > 2 years (from June 2017 to today, Aug 2019).  Somewhere around 10 months to a year ago, one of the the spring bars broke out of the plastic hole on the watch due to excessive pressure since the nato strap was such a tight fit. So, I simply drilled 2 tiny holes in the watch and ran some 50 lb fishing line through and tied it off. Problem solved! That lasted about another year until the watch got water inside it just last week while swimming. I wonder if it was due to those holes I drilled somehow letting water in. I should have drilled sideways through the plastic tabs in the same holes where the spring bar used to connect instead of drilling down through the side of the plastic case like I did. Lesson learned: I'll do that next time.Anyway, time for another watch. Buying this same one would be a good buy.My only complaints about this watch are:1. It's bigger than preferred (I'd prefer a women's size watch honestly due to carpal tunnel wrist pain caused by doing pushups for decades and typing all day--the larger mens watches like this jam up into my wrist while doing pushups and exacerbate the situation)2. The time zone gets changed randomly sometimes while exercising or doing pushups, since a button accidentally gets pressed.3. The countdown timer has second-resolution (yaaay!, that's good!) but does *not* have the auto-repeat feature the G-Shock I had years ago had, which means I have to manually restart the watch after each countdown. I liked having the option to make it auto-restart the countdown when doing things like running laps or doing repetitive drills where I want to switch the activity every X seconds or minutes.That's all, folks. It's a good watch at a good price. 4 years 24/7 is highly respectable. And the nato strap? It's still in great shape. Good for another 6 years or so I bet (10 years total).",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2017",RyanT2,"This is my favorite Casio watch I think. Even with my small collection of G-Shocks, and a few other Casio models, this is my favorite. This watch is my go to at home functional watch and my watch when I need to be really mindful of the time when I am out.Functions:Excellent backlight for Casio. Casio usually has ok backlights (Never quite as good as Timex), but the low end casio watches are usually lacking...not this one. It has a good backlight that lasts for a second or two when pressed that illuminates the entire time readout. This is a huge win for me as I use a light frequently to check a watch at night and in the early morning.Timer and Stopwatch: These are both on the watch and easy to use. They are effective at what they do and the alarms are load enough to hear them with mild ambient sound. Maybe not so much in a super loud environment, but normally I do not think this would be an issue.World Time: Also very easy to figure out and has an awesome map. I split my time between London and Los Angeles as we have our International office located in the UK and I like to readily know what time it is for my team out there. I also love the map, it makes it easy to tell when you are approaching the right timezone so you don't always blow passed it when searching for your own. Not to mention I just enjoy the aesthetics.Size and Style: This watch is very light for being pretty big. It is true to size and does not wear much bigger that it seems. I have small rests, but it feels comfortable and looks good. It does have some retro styling, this watch has not changed in a long time, and I feel that is a strong positive for it. It looks good. I have both this version and the round one, and this one is way better. The pushers on the round one are not metal. I took the band off and paired it with a Barton Brand green canvas 18mm band and it looks real nice.Some people mod these a little, or at least remove the wording on the case. I left mine alone, and will probably not attempt to mod it. The strap it comes with is comfortable enough, but cheap, so I would recommend another 18mm band. The Barton Brand 18mm quick fitting buckle band looked really good on this.So, for the price of the watch and maybe another 15 bucks, you can get an excellent all around watch that has functionality to perform tons of jobs around the house and even in travels for less than $50. I plan on using this whenever I am abroad for its ease of use, durability, and cost if it is broken or stolen. And yes the watch has good water resistance and has stood up through washing dishes, showers, getting knocked around during yard work, etc. Yes, it will pick up scratches, but the case and plastic crystal hold up pretty well for all of that.I highly recommend this watch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2019",Anton,"The Casio AE-1200 is an amazing watch at an incredibly affordable price.

In that time, it's drifted 27 seconds (e.g. at 8:00:00 it now reads 8:00:27). **EDIT** This drift is inaccurate. Updated at bottom of review **END EDIT**. For me, that's not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it. I wear the watch face-side down on my wrist, but it only accrued one mild scratch in all that time. Nothing terrible. I bought this watch because it had 3 things; the 24-hour time, the day of the week, and the date on a single screen. It's the only watch I've found that had all 3 of those. To find all 3 in a highly rated and CHEAP watch? I bought it in a second and haven't regretted it since. I actually returned a better and more expensive watch (Casio DW5600E-1V) before eventually finding and loving this. I especially love that it orders the date in Year-Month-Day format. I live in the US where Month-Day-Year is the norm, but I also work with thousands of computer files where the best way to organize files by date is with a Year-Month-Day system (e.g. 221102 for November 2, 2022). It's just a little nothing thing, but I love this watch for it.I should note that the watch band snapped off back in August, 2 years and 5 months after getting the watch. That's happened with other watches with resin bands that I've owned, always around the 2-3 year mark. I heard it's from sweat or showers hardening the resin or something. That could make sense as I never take mine off except when I'm rock climbing. Regardless, I just grabbed a cheap 18mm silicone watch strap for 12.99 and it's been fine ever since (bought silicone because I heard they don't snap. I'll update this if it ever does).I plan to use this watch forever. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one for the price of a burger + onion rings. I've gone through a dozen watches over the past 25 years or so, but this is the first one that I loved. It has everything I want without a bunch of other useless expensive crap that I'll never use (looking at you, altimeter; and that's coming from a hiker). It's cheap, reliable (anecdotally), has a fast band replacement process, no feature-bloat, has large text, and is DECENTLY water resistant. The only downside is that the watch isn't 200m water resistant. If it was, it'd be perfect for me. Anyway, I don't go surfing/swimming with it, but it hasn't fogged up after 2+ years of showers, rain, sweat, etc. If you want a cheap watch, I recommend this one (unless you're an avid surfer). Or if you're like me and willing to fork over $100 for a watch, maybe buy this anyway. It's certainly much better than the $21 price-tag would have you believe.**EDIT** 12/12/23I made the above review over a year ago, but I realized that I couldn't verify that the 27 seconds of drift was accurate. Well, I decided to run a little experiment over the past year and record the drift every few months (basically whenever I remembered I was even doing this) and it turns out that the drift WASN'T accurate. After a year, my watch drifted 58 seconds. To get that 27 second value, I might have reset my watch whenever we had daylight saving time or something, hence the inaccurate drift. Anyway, I included the recorded values below (MM/DD/YY format) in case someone is interested. Also, I used time.gov for the baseline comparison.12/11/22  9:55PM - 0 seconds fast01/19/23  6:18PM - 5 seconds fast02/22/23  12:48PM - 10.5 seconds fast04/15/23  9:00PM - 18.5 seconds fast05/08/23  8:22PM - 22 seconds fast06/27/23  12:52PM - 30 seconds fast09/06/23  8:15PM - 41 seconds fast11/05/23  7:18PM - 51 seconds fast12/11/23  9:55PM - 58 seconds fastThis basically means my watch drifts by a little more than 1 second every week (1sec/~6.29days). For my needs, that's fine. I'm not doing anything in my daily life that requires long-term precision to the second, and I have to reset it every so often anyway for the aforementioned daylight saving time, so I don't mind at all. Other than that, the watch still works great (nearing 4 years now) and the ""new"" silicone watchband is still great too (although it hasn't hit that 2-3 year breakdown point yet). So, all in all, still happy with it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2022",Amazon Customer,"I have been using this for a few weeks. I've done a couple hikes that included cliff jumping, climbing, and water for multiple hours. I took it scuba diving for two days and we were in the ocean constantly. It held up perfectly. I dove for two days averaging 30-40 feet deep but 65 at the deepest. It did great for all of that. I used the stopwatch underwater multiple times. The display is crisp and clear. Buttons are perfect size. Easy to push even with scuba gloves but they don't dig into your wrist. The light works great. It doesn't stay on for more than a second unless you hold it but I like that. Less battery wasting. The strap is a little long. I have small wrists so I cut it shorter. I regretted that in a thick 7ml wetsuit when the long strap would have been nice, but it still worked. I've seen others exhange the straps. The alarm is enough to wake up with. It beeps 10 times and then stops. It will go again every 5 minutes if you have the snooze setting on. So far I have one tiny scratch on the surface. Only noticeable if you really look for it. That's pretty good for the abuse I've already put it through. My favorite part about it is that it replaces having to get my phone out or turned on for time, stopwatch, and alarm while I'm backpacking/hiking/diving.

I'm a little surprised that even my wife has mentioned a couple of times that it's a nice looking watch. Don't get me wrong, no one will mistake it for a $300 watch but I like how it looks and that's good enough for me. I wanted an inexpensive daily watch with Arabic numerals, easy to read and not too cluttered, with a little bit of field watch look and this watch met the need. For comparison's sake, the other option I was considering was a Seiko 5 field type watch, which would be fine but also at least 3 times more expensive and I didn't want another Japanese watch, I already have a Citizen Promaster so I'm good on that score and I didn't feel like coughing up a few hundred bucks for a Swiss automatic movement. I'll list my pros and cons and make it short:Pros:- good looking face, large Arabic numerals- size is about right for my personal taste, I don't like larger diameter watches but some people do- light weight was moderately important to me- accuracy, telling the time accurately is a watch's reason for being, and I think this is plenty accurate, about the same my Citizen Promaster or even a little tighter, really, but I'm not such an important person as to worry about a couple of seconds off here and there- solar, so no battery changes to fool around with the Expedition Solar version I purchasedCons: I don't have any strong negative opinions for this watch, particularly considering the price bracket we are in, but I will say- the lume is a little on the weak side, it doesn't last very long in my opinion so it would be hard to read at night or in a dark environment- height, I could wish it were a little thinner, it's not terrible but I just feel it sits a little taller than it has a right toTo sum it up again, it's very decent watch and I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2024",,,2.24 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,KJ,"I’m very pleased with this watch.  I’ve had it three weeks and it has been keeping good time.  I like the gold/brass color of the case and the clarity of the glass.  The face is easy to read and the cream face color is handsome and a nice contrast, less glaring than the white my previous Timex had.  Setting the date is not a problem, as some other reviews have stated.  Once you find the required “middle” position of the stem between all the way in and all the way out, it becomes pretty natural and is easy to remember.  Speaking of the date, I wish they kept the day of the week presentation that my previous Timex had, but that’s a relatively small disappointment.  The band is excellent.  It’s a soft suede-like leather that’s very flexible.  The trim stitching is very well done; straight, even,  and all finishings are secured and tucked away so that there are no loose ends or fraying looks.  The two belt loops, one fixed close behind the buckle and the other sliding further down the strap are great for keeping the strap close to the wrist.  All-in-all, a great buy for the price!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2022",Amazon Customer,"Timex - hard to beat.  Watch arrived in new condition packaged in genuine plastic Timex display/packaging. A sticker on the package states: movement and assembly: Philippines, strap: China.  Regarding waterproofing, per the enclosed literature : "" Is water resistant only as long as lens, buttons, and case remain intact;...is not a diver's watch (not to be used for diving );...and the caveat not to push any buttons whilst underwater. It also states 30 meter water resistance; without a screw down winding stem, I would be skeptical of that claim and I personally won't be submerging this particular watch.The watch strap is stamped ""genuine leather upper""; appears to be good quality, stitched well and blemish free. Changing the date is simple: pull the stem out about less than midway and turn- left or right - until the desired date  is shown and push stem back in. The date window is not magnified and quite small, but the date is readable. There is an audible ticking sound. However, my hearing isn't all that hot anymore and I need to put it next to my ear to hear it.The whole watch is fairly light, not like an auto winding Swiss chronograph. The numerals and the hands are black and contrast well against the watch face, the second sweep hand is gold colored. Pushing the stem in activates the Indiglo feature: the watch face is backlight and the numerals and hands are boldly and easily readable.Someone asked if this a knockoff because it is so inexpensive; the Red Bull'seye Store sells the same watch for exactly the same price as on this site. These modest Timex watches are fairly inexpensive and this is no exception.So, if you are looking for an easy to read watch, night or day, doesn't cost too much offered by a brand that has been around since 1854,  and has a certain understated style, you might want to consider the Easy Reader watch collection line.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2019",Dennis Rutledge,Love my watch!

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Buck,"This watch is fun to wear and has all the features I want. It has an attractive blue dial that absorbs light to charge the battery. I shouldn't need to replace the battery for decades. I have one Eco Drive watch that is 23 years old and still using the first battery. It has a stopwatch that is easy to use that measures to 1/20th of a second, day of the week retrograde subdial, date window with a matching blue background. The date is a perpetual calender so it shows the correct date no matter what month it is and during leap years. The retrograde day of the week subdial looks nice and I like the 24 hour subdial.The stopwatch can be accessed by pressing one pusher. Press it again for start/stop then press the other button to clear it back to zero and again to go back to timekeeping mode. It's very easy to use. You don't have to turn the crown to access the stopwatch. It's a one hour timer so the hour and minute hands will continue to keep time while the second hand and stopwatch subdial work as the stopwatch.This is an atomic watch. It receives a signal from the nearest atomic clock every night and corrects the time and will automatically adjust for daylight savings time if you have that feature on. It has a signal indicator so you can see when it is updating and you can check at any time whether it updated the night before. You can even use the atomic clock signal for the initial time and date setup but you will still need to set whether you want to use daylight savings time during the summer.This watch is a set it and forget it watch. Just charge it up with sunlight near a window for the first week (it needs a lot of light in the beginning to reach a max charge) then set the time, date, day and DST if you want it and as long as the watch gets enough light to keep it charged you will never have to change anything on it again. Remember, you can use the atomic clock signal to initially set everything but the DST setting if you want to. The signal is strongest at night and the watch needs a sufficient charge before changing any settings. You can also find easy step by step instructions for setting this watch on You Tube. Search for how to set the Citizen H800 module.I like the stainless steel bracelet of this watch. It's comfortable and nice looking but I wear mine on a Borealis 24mm blue vintage style dive strap. It's extremely comfortable and the adjustment holes are very close together so I always have a perfect fit. The strap thins out near the buckle so it isn't so thick on the bottom of the wrist where it overlaps like some dive straps. This watch has 23mm lugs but the 24mm rubber strap easily compresses to fit this watch. The color match is amazing. I also bought some 23mm navy blue leather Racing and Rally straps from Barton Straps that look very nice on this watch. Those are made with Horween leather. Barton also has a Classic leather strap. Barton Straps can be found here on Amazon. Look for Barton Horween leather Racing strap. The Barton Racing strap looks similar to the strap Citizen sells for this watch but is made with much better leather and costs less, at least when I purchased it.If you are looking for a low maintenance nice looking stainless steel watch with a blue dial that will always show the correct time and date and has a stopwatch then this is the watch for you. Once you set the time, date and DST you should never have to worry about those settings again. Just wear and enjoy this watch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024",Bill,"First, I should mention that I tried several E6B watches before I settled on this one.  The others were Seiko models, a brand I have worn for the past 20 years.  The Seiko models are all well built but I could not read the slide rule scales except in bright lighting conditions.  The main issue was the size of the text and scribe lines on the Seikos.  There is a lot going on in a very small space.  The slide rule on this Citizen watch is easier to read and work with.In no particular order here are my observations after having worn the AT8020-54L for a few weeks now:First, the watch is a solid, well-built machine.  The workmanship is excellent as are fit and finish.  The face is large and easy to read.  The numbers and hands are not very bright at night and it takes me a moment or two to orient, though they are readable.  I do miss the bright radium dials we had when I was younger.The watch band was a little on the small side for my large hands and wrist right out of the box.  It left a faint imprint on my wrist whenever I removed it.  As the watch band came at its largest setting there was no way to lengthen it without adding another link. Citizen to the rescue-turns out they will send you an additional link at no charge. Great customer service! The OEM band is solidly made and the clasp has a positive locking feature - very nice.The precision of the slide rule scales is the best I've encountered in E6Bs.  A large 43mm case means more space for the slide rule text.  There is a single scale on the outer bezel which is easier to read than other E6B's I have tried.  The bezel is rotated using the knob at the 8 o'clock position.  The bezel is completely contained inside the watch face and will not be knocked out of alignment by bumping against something.  If you wear gloves the knob can be tricky to get hold of.  The scales align precisely around the circumference when ""60"" is rolled to the 12 o'clock position.  There is no tachometer scale (hyperbolic function) on this watch so you have to do that math logarithmically.  Use the stop watch to measure the time for a single event in secs, then place 36 (for 3,600 - converting secs to hours) on the outer scale over that time for a single event on the inner scale.  Look outside the 10 mark on the inner scale to see your answer in units per hour.The stop watch has a 1/20th of a sec resolution and is quite precise.  It does NOT have a split time feature though.  You can start and stop the second counter by pressing the upper knob but when the watch is stopped, so is its time keeping function.  As a race fan I really miss the split time feature.The watch has a small radio receiver and will try to update itself relative to established atomic references each morning.  There is a small scale to the left of the lower subdial which indicates if the latest update was successful.  I have an atomic reference app on my iPhone which is well within a small fraction of a second with the watch as I write this.  I believe the watch is the more accurate of the two.As a perpetual calendar watch, I am ecstatic that I should never have to set the date again.  The watch accommodates leap years and any month with less than 31 days.  It also manages to handle daylight savings automatically if you toggle that feature.The watch is powered by a rechargeable battery which gets its charge from photovoltaics cleverly integrated into the watch face.  They are well-hidden - I cannot spot them.  Well done Citizen.  The upper subdial indicates the charge level and I have never seen it come off the full charge mark but the batteries are still young.The middle subdial (9 o'clock position) presents a 24 hr clock face.  It would be nice if this dial could be set to Zulu time while the main watch indicated local.  Maybe this can be done?  I still have not figured out all the features this thing brings to the fight.Resetting the time for different time zones is simple.  Around the inside of the watch bezel are 3-letter representations of different major cities (time zones) around the globe.  Pull the crown out to the first setting and the second hand moves to point to the current time zone by major city.  Twist the crown and the second hand moves discretely from city to city until you're happy.  Close the crown and the watch will reset itself automatically to the new time and date, daylight savings included.  So simple.  Here are some of the cities: NYC, RIO, LON, ATH, TYO, HKO, SYD, LAX, et al.All in all, this is a very nice watch for the price.  I just wish it had split times so I could watch the Audis pull away from the Peugeots at le Mans.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2015",TechJ Sus,"I had regrets after buying this because I saw another watch I wanted with a steel bracelet and thought there's no reason to get this one as I already have a skyhawk, but wow!  This watch is beautiful, fits great, and looks decent.  Some cool aspects -The minute hand moves every 15 seconds 1/4 of a minute instead of just once every 60 seconds.The watch is insanely accurate in movement - the seconds hand but also the 1/10th when running chronometer.Chronometer 1/10th dial stops after 30 seconds and then when stopwatch is stopped it returns to the position it should be in, saving battery so the chronometer can run for hours.The radio controlled setting is fun and smooth and easy to use.  The watch as a whole is extremely simple once you read the manual - this is my second citizen AT that I've not had to set manually at all.  I love that it can handle summer timezones automatically if set to.The blue IP plating is the only part I worry about - it's hard and durable and made to last, but when it chips that will significantly degrade the look of the watch IMO.I have a little over a 7 inch wrist and I find the band extremely comfortable after resizing (to resize you need to poke the pins holding the links together in the direction of the arrow on the inside of the bracelet, and to reconnect make sure to push the same pins back in in the same direction as the arrow.). Resizing took me about 5 minutes but if you mess up with the direction of the arrows it can take a lot longer.  Do only one side at a time to avoid mixing links and arrow directions.Finally, it always shows there's only one or two in stock but these watches are always in stock.  Don't get pressured into buying them on sale because they are always on sale.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2023",2017,,6.3 ounces,,,,,,

I think the size and shape are just right and I like the functionality. I was a little worried that it might be a little big and bulky on my wrist but I think it fits just right. I have an average size wrist and the watch doesn't look abnormally big on me.I really like the solar function. I wore Timex Ironman watches for years but changing the batteries was such a hassle due to the difficulty in getting the back off with the wrist band in the way. And I had to replace a couple of watches when I didn't get the back sealed properly and water got inside. I'm hoping that with this solar powered one, battery replacement is a thing of the past! It really doesn't take much effort to keep the battery fully charged. When I got the watch in the mail the battery level was at the third level (of four), or the level just below full charge.  Initially it took a little bit to get the charge up to full and it went back and forth from full charge to down a level a few times over the first few days. I'm assuming the watch had been sitting in a warehouse out of the light for who knows how long so it probably needed some extended light exposure to fully charge. After a few days I was careful the expose the watch to direct sunlight for longer periods and that brought the charge up to full and it stayed there. Since then I haven't made any special effort to expose the watch face to light (sun or electric), just the exposure it gets through normal everyday use, and it has stayed fully charged.I've been really happy with the atomic timekeeping as well. The instructions go to great lengths to explain how you need to position the watch a certain way on a window sill at night so that the watch can receive the time keeping radio signals. It sounded like it was going to be a real pain since I prefer to sleep with my watch on.  So far my watch hasn't missed the signal once even though it stays on my wrist in bed at night. I imagine that results might vary depending on where in the country (or world) you live and what the surrounding terrain is like. I live in the northeast US and in pretty hilly terrain but so far, no problems with reception.Other than those specifics, I like the overall look and function of the watch. I was concerned the numbers might be a little small but so far that has been fine. Figuring out the controls was not difficult. I did read the instruction manual to find out about some of the specific functions but overall I just played with the buttons a little bit and most of it is pretty intuitive.I've only had the watch for a few weeks so I can't speak toward it's long term durability but it definitely seems very well constructed and I look forward to many years of service.  It looks like the band is relatively easy to replace should the need arise. Overall I think it is a great watch. If you are looking for something that is functional and durable, I highly recommend the G-Shock GW6900-1!",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2015",Jeff K,"I have several G-Shocks, from the classic squares to the bigger and more bulky modern ones.  This one, is about the best value-for-dollar model they make.From a feature perspective, this is the perfect G-Shock for pilots, military personnel, or IT people who deal a lot with  Zulu (UTC) time, since a quick press of the top right button will show both world time and local time on the face at the same time.The 5 alarms are once again great for military people, as you can set them (for instance) 10 minutes before: reveille, morning chow, noon chow, evening chow, and taps.  Great if you're running a team and need to get your folks to a stopping point before the typical daily events.  They're loud enough to hear, unlike some of the other solar g-shocks, but since I have tinnitus from... life, they could always be louder.Stopwatch and timers - all excellent, and very useful.This is also the most comfortable G-Shock I've ever had.  The case being a little larger than the squares, and the way the case is tapered on the bottom is very ergonomic.  It's one of the very few I don't feel the urge to install adaptors and a NATO strap.Tough solar means that you won't have to worry about power, even if you use the backlight a bunch, and you'll want to because the EL backlight on this thing is beautiful.  Bright enough so it's very easily readable, but not so bright that it will kill your night vision.  The solar capacitor should be good for at least 15 years if kept properly charged, and it's easy to replace if it ever goes bad (they cost about $20.)The Multi-Band 6 sync is a welcome added bonus.  While it's not quite as sensitive as the GW-M5610, if I leave it in my window it will always sync overnight (in Los Angeles).  It's important to find a spot in your house where the longwave signal is strong.  It's helpful to learn a bit about longwave signal propagation; it will help you understand why it works better at night and why position is so important.Of course, it's a G-shock, so if it's on your wrist, there's nothing that will break the watch that will not also remove your arm.  If the case or strap gets dinged, or painted, or burned, or... anything, the bezel and bands are completely replaceable in just a few minutes with a springbar tool and a small phillips screwdriver.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022",,,,,2020,,3.99 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Mr. Manalyst,"Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical. A decent, let alone good, watch at this price from ... ahem ... Invicta? Well, my experience 2 weeks or so into ownership has pretty much proven my suspicions to be ill-founded. This is a terrific watch, made all the better because of the ""silly"" price. Pay 20x the money or much more, if you want, in terms of a quality watch, you won't do better. OK, it doesn't say Omega or Rolex on the dial. But, let me take you through my likes and dislikes.1. Appearance.It looks terrific straight out of the case and appears to be well made. On my wrist, I think it looks great -- it's 40mm, ie, medium sized these days, and that suits me.2. Feel.It has a surprising heft. I wasn't expecting this for a watch at this price-point, but it feels substantial, but not overly heavy, when wearing it.  I like that very much -- it's reassuring, somehow, and suggests robustness and superior build quality to my way of thinking.3. Durability.Too soon to tell, overall, However, when I accidentally banged the watch against a heavy metal gate the other day, I winced, fully expecting to find at least a cracked or scratched crystal, or damage to the strap. Nope. Nada. I wasn't just relieved, I was, again, very pleasantly surprised by this piece.4. Reliability.Again, probably too early to say, overall. Again, however, I will say this: my watch has been keeping perfect time. Saying so here will now probably jinx it, but we shall see. I was not expecting this from my own prior experience with an automatic watch, and some of the other reviews here. It wouldn't have bothered me too much, as I viewed time gain/loss as part of the automatic watch experience -- and I like to engage with my devices. Sort of like preferring to drive stick over automatic. It's a personal thing. But, so far, this watch has kept perfect time.5. Automatic movement.I just prefer it to quartz, although quartz is, typically, just perfectly accurate. I didn't want to see the word ""quartz"" on the dial, and I liked seeing the watch-movement on the back of the case. That movement, however, is painted yellow, not left stainless. Initially, I was put off by this because I just didn't like the aesthetic. However, I almost never see it as the watch is on my wrist all the time, and now I've become used to it anyway.6. Service.This also really surprised me. I took delivery of the watch and followed the instructions (or so I thought) to set both the time and the date. Problem: time re-set ok, but not the date, no matter how often I tried. I was disappointed and annoyed with myself. After all, at this price-point, what could I expect? So, I waited 24 hours and was advised I could either get a complete refund or a replacement. If io ted for the replacement, i would have 30 days to return the original, or else my card would be charged again. I opted for the replacement, which arrived a few days later. Again, I was unable to set the date, although the setting the time went flawlessly. Again I was frustrated, but also skeptical of the possibility that not one but two watches had the identical issue. Perhaps the problem wasn't with the watch, but with me -- perhaps I was doing something wrong? I took them to a nearby jeweler/Invicta dealer, who showed me that, yes indeed, the problem was me. When setting the date, even though you are going forward, you have to wind backwards, ie, counter-clockwise. Problem solved! I therefore returned the replacement watch and kept the original. Yes, the instructions in the box could have been clearer, but I was mightily impressed by the Seller (Amazon?) immediately sending me a replacement with no questions asked, and then giving me 30 days to return the original before charging my card.7. The""unboxing"" experience.People post YouTube videos of themselves unboxing their latest doo-dad all the time. Certainly, there is something satisfying about unboxing your new iProduct or Cartier that adds to the whole ownership experience. This, for me, was not that. The box is a horrible vinyl. The yellow color isn't exactly subtle, but would probably look better in cardboard. I don't keep it out anywhere visible. The instructions are stuffed into the lid and don't fit. It all looks and feels wrong. The watch itself was covered in a number of transparent protective tapes, that were tricky to remove and required some patience. All that said, none of these (minor) gripes have affected my overall, very positive experience.8. Value For Money.You could get yourself the quartz version for about $30 cheaper at the time of writing. While that's not nothing, and is about a full one-third less than this watch, I opted for this model. The quartz model also has a slightly different bezel, one which I actually prefer as it's a little more modern and subtle, without the classic, jagged ""teeth."" This watch has the traditional look. However, for me, an automatic stainless-steel diver's watch with these looks, heft and reliability at this price, represents excellent VFM.9.Conclusion.If you're considering this watch, I say buy it. It's very reasonably priced for what it is and you'll have ample time to return it if you don't like it.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2016",Laxluver1234,"This has been my first automatic type watch purchase. I refused to dive head first into purchasing, what could be considered a ""higher end"" brand as my first automatic. Examples include citizens (eco-drive), Seiko, Movado (I have one non-automatic), Bulova (I have two non-automatic) and so on. I'm pinching pennies as it is with the economy as it is. What does someone do when they want a watch for a price that won't break the bank, looks nice, functions well, and you can see yourself wearing it frequently?I rarely wear my Movado or Bulova's - matter of fact, I put those in a safe years ago. I only wore them with business suites etc. As daily wear watches, I've bought throw aways over the years. Casio digital watch, timex, no brand names and hell, even a smart watch (which I rarely used to it's full purpose)Enter the Invicta Pro Diver**Pros**- Watch Feels Solid - The band feels like good construction and so does the watch- Band is not loud - I can't really describe what I mean by this but some watch band links ""cling"" togetherwhen you move or the watch moves. Like it's cheap and loose. Not this band. It's solid.- Looks great - The colors on the band, dial, and so on really pop- Keeping good time - It arrived active already - I set the time last night, right to the second, and so far it's right on the money (I used my desktops windows time to nail the seconds down)- Higher end movement - I did a lot of research on the Seiko movement (NH35A) and according to some online sources, this is a 40.00 dollar movement by itself.- Water Resistance - I was looking forward to having a watch I could wear at all times. Even in the shower. Something as trivial as needing to take a watch off to shower and put back on after is annoying. I showered with it and (**important** make sure the crown is screwed down and tight to turn clockwise) I have no issues to report**Cons**- Clasp Quality - The clasp feels solid for the most part. I could foresee it wearing down over time. Kind of why I've decided to rarely, if ever, take off the watch. I'm not too worried about this.- Does not glow in the dark very well - I don't really know much about the science behind luminous but I can tell you that I'm simply not able to tell the time in the dark. It does glow but not bright enough in my opinion.- Invicta Branding - Some may have no issue with having an ""Invicta"" engraving on the bezel and the Invicta symbol on the second hand. Some may find that tacky. I personally don't really care.**Take Away**I'm happy with my purchase. I paid 74 bucks (I'm including taxes etc. in that price) for an automatic watch that functions well, looks great, is solid built, and will accomplish what I had as an end goal for buying my first automatic watch. Time will tell (pun intended) how well this watch holds up. I'm not a very daily active person. Meaning I work in an office setting. Not much going on that could cause any sort of issue for the watch. I am active during the week and on the weekends going to the gym etc. I plan on wearing the watch throughout all of those activities. I'll definitely be putting the watch through its paces.If you're just getting into the automatic side of watches, in a market saturated by countless brands mimicking other brands, and where a decent name ""high end brand"" starts at 150.00 (for really bottom barrel automatics) , to better looking name brand watches priced 300.00 to 500.00 , and you're wanting to save a buck, I think you'll be happy buying this watch.It checked most if not all my checkboxes.

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Ron Kramer,"Less than 75 bucks?5 stars on first impression. Let me tell you a story. I love CHEAP watches and GREAT watches. I own 2.59 cent LCD cheapo's I think are amazing and I own a 2400.00 Rolex and 1700.00 Tag. Well the Rolex is almost 26 years old and (though it works great and looks awesome) don't I need a change? The Tag was a change, but again 12 years old and now wanting it's 2nd battery we're talking around 220 bucks. (just for the battery replace).Loving watches in general, I've always wanted the invicta TV channel shows but never bought. Seems to good to be true? Well this time I needed a new Battery of 220 again and thought - maybe try a 200 buck Invicta. Reading reviews that said things like the crown and springs popped out and Invicta charging them for repairs made me worried about spending 200-300-400. Other reviews of HUGE AND HEAVY worried me. I shopped and shopped and added those I liked to my WATCH LIST. Feeling secure that if I buy from AMAZON - I'm able to return.So after thinking on it - I just couldn't bring myself to buy 300+ for something that may arrive broken. I ordered one... this one. Because it looks great and what the heck - it was like 65.00 bucks. I buy...NEXT DAY Amazon shows me a SALE on them for 25% off. What! So before the first one even came, I ordered two more since I couldn't pass on that savings. Total cost - very close to a new battery replacement in my TAG.The showed up (2 boxes) at the same time. I open one and get this one first. My jaw dropped. FIRST LET ME SAY that the Japanese internals are 1/2 the thickness of the Swiss units. At these cheap prices - do I really care who made it? So many people have said I've sent it back because it was to big and to heavy. I'm use to a large watch (TAG and ROLEX are not light, though thinner than swiss and Japanese Invicta.I have very thin/small wrists. (150lb 5'7"") Well putting the watches on (all 3 of them) I have to use the smallest or 2nd from the smallest hole available. (so that give you an idea) the sizes of the faces are large and I like that. The weight of this one is lighter than the others and I like that. But the other swiss ones aren't uncomfortable.Now at these prices - I hope to update my review should anything negative arise. They've not been in water and thought I've had my Rolex and Tag scuba diving all over the US and Caribbean, I don't really dive any more. But I do sail aggressively catamarans. (VERY WET) so we shall see.I HATE scratches on crystals - so we shall see that over time as well. I don't know what the heck a flame fusion is (someone made that up). My 27 and 12+ year old Rolex and Tag do not have scratches. And I'm ROUGH on them.The band - RUBBER? is cheap, but looks like it will last. I WONDER IF IT WILL GET STICKY to my wrist in warm humid weather? But should wear well and not deteriorate with water use.  (THE BAND FOR THIS ONE IS A BIT DIFFERENT) original review was on  Japanese model But I got this at the same time.Being AMAZED at what I received for a bit over 200.00 it then hit me. NOW I HAVE 3 BATTERIES that will likely need replacing at the same time!? SHOOT I never considered that. I wonder what the cost of batteries in these will be? And if it might just be smarter to throw them in a drawer and get a new look at that time? I hate jewelry - so these are my only sort of bling I wear. I'll toss a few photos in here - and will update later if I find any negatives to these item.

My father, who was a teen in late 70s and 80s was concerned that I would get made fun of at school because, not only were they more expensive back then, only super-geeks wore calculator watches when he was in school; I guess that still applied to the mid-to-late-90s as Casio Calculator Watches hadn't become old enough to be retro-chic yet.  My friend, a 30-something exec, recently bought one and I was immediately reminded of how badly I wanted one as a kid and was ecstatic when he told me it was only $15.Upon first purchasing the watch, I felt that I would mostly just use it as a fashion statement more or less -- some kind of geek hipster I guess.  But I use this thing all the time: Tips on food, BitCoin conversions, tallying my PostMates delivery totals, all kinds of daily math!  I have a genuine need for the second time zone too, having relatives and family in another country and I use the stopwatch frequently to time things like workouts and bike rides as well as walking times to all the facilities I use on a daily basis so that I can find the fastest routes (I'm a big nerd, I know).  I probably use this watch for something other than telling time around 10 times a day.I have an iPhone and, sure, I could do all the same things on the iPhone and more than this cheap little watch, but the watch is right there on my wrist!  I don't have to take it out, unlock it, and find whatever app I need to use, I just turn my wrist and get straight into it.  Sure, I could get an Apple Watch, but I don't see the need to spend $350 on what is essentially a second phone at this point in my life and many of the same problems that come from the complexity of so much versatility would still get in the way.  And I can't imagine what using a calculator with such a tiny touch-screen would be like.  Even if they're tiny, the Casio's buttons are physical, which goes a long way to being easy to press.If you are a fan of calculators, geeky things, cheap useful things, or Back to the Future and Marty McFly don't hesitate.This watch is fantastic.  Casio was way ahead of their time in the late 70s and 80s, not with just this watch but all the fitness and calculator watches they produced.  This is an icon of an era of extreme leaps in personal computing technology.Features:* Watch (either 12 or 24 hour) with day of the week indicator and toggle to see year, month and day* Basic Calculator supporting up to 8 digits and supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, as well as basic exponents* Alarm (can also set an hourly chime from here)* Alternate timezone* Stopwatch: chimes every 10 minutes, can record multiple laps.PROS:+ Cheap!+ 5 functions: Clock, Calculator, Alarm, Alternate Timezone, Stopwatch+ Option to have watch chime on the hour+ Can technically multitask (run the stopwatch in the background while you use other functions)+ Durable and Water Resistent+ Alarm is a good volume+ Keeps precise time (I synced it to time.gov several days ago and it's still accurate to the precise second)+ Because of it's simplicity, it just works+ Surprisingly feature-full for such simple technology.CONS:- I personally wish the holes in the arm band were offset 50%.  One hole is slightly too tight and the next is slightly too lose.

I wish that it had a light, but that's my only thing that I would change.  And this watch gets people's attention if that's your thing.

Usable bezel for timing events, 100m water resist, light weight, day/ date, decent lume with a charge from a light.....and it's very accurate. Need a watch under $20? Even under $50,  this is a good choice. Great travel watch. You don't need more.Update 2/19I have beaten on this watch like a red headed geek.....given it zero respect, with no regard to its well being....and it hasnt skipped a beat...its very accurate , loses a couple seconds a week maybe. For this price and to get this tactical cool look....its literally a zero brain proposition. It has a plastic crystal - making it uber light weight, but takes some scratches - so what?. I have pounded this thing doing chores, laundry, dishes, showers, grocery shopping, dog walking - all of the daily tactical things one does in the crazed world we live in. For the price, if you like understated simplicity and value for cash, this is it. When I do step out, and forget I have it on, I dont feel under watched, I still feel as if people will look at it and think it looks cool, masculine, even a little tactically sexy. The bezel is always being used to time things - from cooking, to whatever you need to keep track of.....you can use a dive type bezel is various ways - by minutes, or use it as an hourly reminder - say you want to remember when you last did something say, 1:30pm, just stick the red triangle at the mid point between 1 and 2, so you know it was 1:30 you did that item..etc, you get the idea....so for $15 bucks or so...you get that utility, in an accurate watch, that is durable, looks cool, has Day and Date, and some lume, just enough lume to work with....really, these watches are ideal for this money. You can really thump hard on this little red headed geek, but its always going to be your friend. Oh, and the other thing its great for - a tactical ""sleeping"" watch.....you dont want to have a bulky or heavy watch on at night....but you should have one - because you never know whats going to happen in the middle of the night - you dont even pay attention to this thing....its pretty much weightless....just charge the lume with a light or flashlight before bed, you will be able to see it well enough at 3am in pitch dark if needed. Forget a G Shock as a beater, why spend the money? $15 bucks, get a couple to just plop in your different vehicles or desk at work etc....reset them every 2 or 3 months and you are always good to go on the timepiece. Zero Brainer purchase.

It does all the basics: hour, minute and second hand, date and day of the week, and it has a movable bezel like dive watches. And it's water resistant up to 10 bars, or 333 feet. That's pretty amazing for twenty-five bucks. I've paid ten times that amount for watches that do no more than this one. The black is very attractive. I replaced the chintzy-looking rubber strap with a good looking black leather strap.  I don't know how long this watch will last, but I've had Casios that lasted ten years. I had another one like that that a friend gave me but it quit working, and the 25 bucks for a new one is less than a horologist would charge to fix the old one.",4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2024",2014,,2.08 ounces,,,,,,

Click here to make a request to customer service.,Noel Carboni,"My son gave me this watch on Father's day, though we had ordered it together here from Amazon some weeks ago (he wanted to make sure I got exactly what I wanted).It's a fairly large watch, but not overly large - and REALLY easy to read with older eyes.  The polished stainless case with NATO band looks best IMO and the reflective case makes it seem a little smaller than it would with a brushed or black case.  The Bulova band seems well-made is quite comfortable.I set it to WWV atomic time very carefully and so far in 4 days I can't perceive any variance in the time at all, even looking at the small seconds hand with a jeweler's loupe.  Not even a small fraction of a second.  Hard to say yet whether it's keeping time to within a second a month, but it's certainly on the right track.  Update:  Had it 1 month now and it's gained only about 0.5 seconds vs. atomic time.  That's pretty darned good!I had heard the lume might not be as good as some other watches, but I find it every bit as bright as my Seiko Speedtimer and it seems to remain just about as bright as the Seiko by early morning before dawn as well.The sapphire crystal is thick and flat, with optically flat reflections, but doesn't really stick up as high as you might think by looking at closeup macro photos.  Overall it looks and feels very right and balanced, and I've not had even the slightest trouble reading the time.  There's a lot of contrast in the dial and hands.  The chronometer functions all work great, and the pushers make a very nice tactile click.All in all, this watch is an amazing value for a good quality, durable, highly accurate timepiece with an interesting history as the second watch (beyond the Omega Speedmaster) to have been on an actual moon walk.  Consider getting a Bulova Lunar Pilot before plunking close to the same money down for a plastic moonswatch.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2022",GS006,"I absolutely love this watch, more than my Omegas and more than my previous Rolexes watches. It has a few things that I would change but overall I think the design and engineering are really excellent. I purchased the Nato strap version because it was cheaper but in fact it It's the only 45mm version with a polished case, which I think makes it much less utilitarian and makes it look more expensive.I've seen complaints about this watch being too big. It's not too big, it's just too big for the people who make that complaint. I have a 7 3/4 inch wrist and it fits me perfectly . If you have a smaller wrist buy a smaller watch. This watch does need you to have at least a 7"" wrist and also to have a wide wrist because of the lug-to-lug size. There is a 43.5mm version in two variants if you need smaller and they are stunning. The case is beautifully polished and I really like the unique style of the Chrono pushes. I've read that they were made this way for astronauts using thick gloves to make them easier to press but I like the way they integrate into the case better than traditional pushes. I also like the extra large crown which again makes it very easy to use. The crown has the Accutron logo. On my watch it’s barely visible - that’s the only manufacturing fault I could find. One complaint I have is that it is only water resistant to 50 meters. This might have been good for the moon but we don't live on the moon and it would have been easy I think to have a push in crown/pushers and have at least 100M WR.I never thought I would like a Nato strap. I've always thought “what's the point in putting a really cheap strap on a really nice or expensive watch?” But I'm surprised that this Nato is really nice. It has leather reinforced eyelets, a nice horizontal weave and it absorbs light so it always shows as really deep black. The hardware is highly polished and matches the case. Note that if you buy the non bracelet versions of the 45mm you cannot put the bracelet on it because the lug holes are positioned differently. I don't know what genius came up with this but it's really dumb. It doesn't bother me though as this Nato strap is so nice.The face is absolutely gorgeous. The crystal sits high above the case and some reviews say it “could” chip, but I've never heard of one cracking or chipping. It just adds to the beautiful design. The tachymeter is much higher than the rest of the face; it drops to a chapter ring which in turn is lower than the main body of the face and the sub dials again are lower than the main face but not as low as the chapter ring. The hands and sub hands and all printing are all beautifully white and cleanly done. It's a wonderful design really well executed. The only thing I would change is the 60 minute sub dial which I think is a little too small. The sub dial hands do not have a pointer at the end of them and so it can be difficult to see exactly what minute on the 60 minute sub dial they're pointing to. I would have loved a 12 hour chronograph counter instead of 1/10th Secs but I suppose that would have ruined the authenticity. I very much like the smooth return of the chrono seconds hand on reset and it must put less stress on mechanical parts of the movement than a hand that snaps back.Bulova call this movement NP20. I'm pretty sure it's made by Miyota especially for Bulova (Cal. 8136). That would make sense as Bulova and Miyota are both owned by Citizen. It uses a 399 high drain battery, perfect for chronographs. I believe this movement used to have a date and I can understand why Bulova took it off for authenticity and looks but I'm so used to having a date.So a few minor quibbles you get with any watch but nothing serious. How much do I love this watch? Well I've packed away my Omegas and I purchased a second Lunar Pilot. Nuff Said. Just remember your wrist size, especially the lug to lug measurement.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024",ruleman,"The face of this watch is nearly perfect. The contrast is excellent and the size makes it easy to tell time without wearing reading glasses. It looks sensational. Chrono operation is smooth. I am not a large person and I find the size of the watch to be fine. The accuracy is, after two months, superb. Using the WatchTracker App I measured a gain of 1.6 seconds over two months, or a projected rate of only +10 SPY.  A simple black NATO works perfectly.My only criticism is the chrono-minute dial. It is small and somewhat difficult to read even with reading glasses.All in all, it is a wonderful design and a bargain for the $360 I paid. It is already one of my favorite watches.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024",2018,,4 ounces,,,,,,

Black display is sleek and modern, but a bit harder to read, naturally, than the silver ones. But that's my choice -- in this case, fashion over function. Best part of this watch is the 24-hour DUAL TIME display function -- my second time is always set to GMT in 24-hour format, which I use for work every day. It's also extremely comfortable, lightweight, waterproof and tough. I literally wash it gently with soap and water after a long run or bike ride.

Caveat for the black display only; slightly harder to read.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2022",Shaka,"I really like this watch. I like the simple and low profile of those old school Casio watches.  No pretense, which is my style. As a diver, I wanted one that went down to 100m. So I paid a little extra this time for that feature. The black background and white digits is very unique and gives this watch a sleek look. I think it might be the only one that I've seen with that LCD setup. The only issue I have is when I go swimming it is difficult to nearly impossible to read with googles or masks that are tinted. I can read it well with my clear diving mask when I push the illumination button. But otherwise, I can't read it at all. I have to pull out my diving light which is no big deal. Or in a swimming pool, I will have to surface and remove my goggles to read it. I reckon this will not be a problem for most people, especially if you are purchasing this item based purely on its aesthetics as I basically did. It was too cool to pass up. And I am keeping it. I have the Casio solar power watch that I use instead when going in the water, as a back up to my dive computer. Or when I really need to watch my time in the pool, which is hardly never. I love my tinted and mirrored goggles, but for indoor pool use, I think I'd like a clear set anyhow. Or maybe not, pools at the gym can be disgusting. I also wish the screen was a bit more scratch resistant, but the pool I use in the gym has an almost sandpaper like surface to it, so I just flip my watch to the other side of my wrist to avoid contact with surfaces. I hope they keep this style as when this one dies out, I will definitely buy another one. One thing to look out for with these types of watches. They claim a ten year battery life, but somehow the alarm got activated for midnight everyday. I had to refer to the book to shut it off. It wasn't really a huge problem, but I was worried that it would shorten the battery life. You can apparently replace the battery. Tutorials are available on YT. Having worked on my diving computer, I would probably use some kind of silicone grease on the gasket to ensure water proofing.",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on November 20, 2023",Michael Jameson,For the price of this watch it is worth it.

This monster is a STATEMENT.Unlike many other Invicta watches, the stem and buttons are not protected from water by screwing in. It has a two sub-dial chronometer (seconds / minutes).

I'd like it better if it were a real 1/10th second chronometer for the 3rd sub-dial.The Silicon band is certainly comfortable enough (though again, just massive) and the clasp on the back is just huge.

Esta hermoso vale la pena",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2024",Aram,Its a very nice watch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 11, 2023",Blake Donovan,"This watch has been my companion for the past few months, and I must admit, it has exceeded my expectations in terms of both style and functionality. This timepiece strikes a harmonious balance between classic elegance and modern convenience.The stainless steel case of the watch exudes a timeless charm. Its polished finish and sleek design give off an air of sophistication that seamlessly transitions from casual to formal settings. The silver hue of the stainless steel effortlessly complements the genuine leather strap, creating a tasteful contrast that enhances the watch's overall aesthetic.What truly sets this watch apart is its reliable quartz movement. The precision and accuracy of the quartz movement ensure that I can trust the timekeeping without the need for constant adjustments. The luminous hands and markers also contribute to easy readability, even in low-light conditions, which is a thoughtful touch.The leather strap not only adds to the watch's visual appeal but also ensures a comfortable fit on the wrist. Over time, the leather develops a unique patina, adding character to the watch and making it feel like a personalized accessory. The stainless steel buckle secures the watch in place, and I've found it to be sturdy and reliable.One minor drawback is that the leather strap may require occasional maintenance to keep it looking its best. Leather can be sensitive to moisture and wear, so it's important to take care of it to ensure its longevity.Pros:Timeless and sophisticated designLuminous hands for easy readabilityComfortable and stylish leather strapCons:Leather strap may require occasional maintenance",5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2023",,,14.89 ounces,,,,,,
